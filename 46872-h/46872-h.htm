<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="sc">My Dear Boys</span>:</p>
<p>This tale of &ldquo;The Putnam Hall Rivals&rdquo; is a
companion story to &ldquo;The Putnam Hall Cadets&rdquo;
brought out about a year ago. It relates the further
adventures of Jack Ruddy, Pepper Ditmore,
and their chums, at and near Putnam Hall, an
ideal boarding school for boys, located upon a
beautiful lake in the upper portion of the State
of New York. As at all boarding academies
there are many keen rivalries,&mdash;in the classrooms,
at the gymnasium, on the athletic field, and also
on the lake. The majority of the boys are upright
and open-hearted, but among the cadets
there are to be found a few who are mean and
even base, and these do a number of things which
cause our heroes not a little trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">[vi]</div>
<p>The &ldquo;Putnam Hall Series&rdquo; was started at the
earnest solicitation of a number of my young
friends who had read my &ldquo;Rover Boys Series&rdquo;
and wanted to know more about what had happened
at Putnam Hall previous to the coming of
the three Rover brothers on the scene. When
the Rovers arrived they found at the academy a
set of wide-awake lads, full of fun and &ldquo;go,&rdquo; and
it is about these that the present tale concerns
itself.</p>
<p>Once again I thank the thousands of boys, and
girls too, who have shown their appreciation of
my efforts to amuse and instruct them. May you
enjoy this volume from the first page to the last,
is the earnest wish of the author.</p>
<p class="center">Affectionately and sincerely yours,
<br /><span class="jr"><span class="sc">Arthur M. Winfield</span>.</span>

<h1 title="">THE PUTNAM HALL RIVALS</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">OUT ON THE ICE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Line up, fellows, line up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Jack, my skate strap is loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t take all the afternoon to fix it,
Pep. Remember, we have only three-quarters of
an hour off to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll remember it right enough,&rdquo; grumbled
Pepper Ditmore, as he fixed the skate strap.
&ldquo;And such good skating, too! Isn&rsquo;t it a shame!
I wish we had a whole holiday to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it a week,&rdquo; put in a cadet named Dale
Blackmore. &ldquo;I declare, I almost love skating as
well as I do baseball and football.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all ready?&rdquo; came from Jack Ruddy,
a moment later. &ldquo;I am not going to wait any
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready!&rdquo; was the answering cry, and six
boys lined up on the smooth ice of the lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then go!&rdquo; shouted Jack, and away went the
half-dozen, with Jack at their side, down the lake,
which the keen wind of the day before had swept
almost entirely clear of snow.</p>
<p>They were a merry, light-hearted set of boys,
all bent upon having the best possible time on the
present occasion. Coming out on the ice but a
few minutes before, a race had been quickly arranged,
the winner to be treated to some pie whenever
the others should visit the town and be able
to get it for him.</p>
<p>Of the seven boys making such rapid progress
over the frozen surface of the lake, Jack Ruddy
was the leader in more ways than one. He was
a well-built fellow, with bright, earnest eyes, and
only a few months before had been chosen major
of the school battalion.</p>
<p>In another volume of this &ldquo;Putnam Hall
Series,&rdquo; entitled &ldquo;The Putnam Hall Cadets,&rdquo; I
related the particulars of how the military academy
was organized by Captain Victor Putnam,
who had received his own military training at
West Point, that grand government institution
of ours, and who had also seen strenuous service
under Uncle Sam in the far west. A fall from a
horse had put him in a sick bed, and after his
recovery he had decided to retire from the army
and go to teaching.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>The captain had had considerable money left
to him, and with this he purchased a beautiful
plot of ground on Cayuga Lake, in New York
State, and there he built Putnam Hall, a handsome
structure of brick and stone, shaped like the
letter E, and containing many fine classrooms,
dormitories, a library, messroom, office, and
numerous other apartments.</p>
<p>The academy stood in the middle of a ten-acre
plot. In front was a smooth, grassy parade
ground and also a well-kept wagon road, running
off in the direction of Cedarville, the nearest village
on the lake. To the rear of the school the
grounds ran down to the lake, and here were the
barns and a storehouse on one side, and a gymnasium
on the other, backed up by thick woods,
and on the lake shore a boathouse and a line of
bathing-houses.</p>
<p>The school was organized upon military lines,
and each cadet was attired in military uniform
and was given instruction in military matters
daily. The regular studies were similar to those
at any first-class preparatory school. Captain
Putnam was at the head of the school, and his
first assistant was Josiah Crabtree, and his second
assistant George Strong. The majority of
the boys liked the captain and George Strong very
much, but Crabtree was a sour and morose individual
they all but despised, even though they
had to admit that he was well educated and could
teach when he set his mind to it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>Jack Ruddy and Pepper Ditmore were chums,
hailing from the western part of New York State.
Jack was a trifle older than Pepper, but both were
of the same size. Jack was a whole-souled fellow
and it was small wonder that, at the first
election for officers, the cadets chose him as the
major of the school battalion. Pepper was full
of fun, and this had gained him the nickname of
Imp. He was content to remain &ldquo;a high private
in the rear rank,&rdquo; as he expressed it, but nobody
loved him any the less on that account.</p>
<p>At the academy, Jack and Pepper had speedily
become acquainted with a number who had since
become their warm friends. There was Dale
Blackmore, just introduced, who was a great football
player, and also Henry Lee, who was captain
of Company A, Bart Conners, who was captain
of Company B, Paul Singleton, generally called
Stuffer because of his fondness for eating, Andy
Snow, an acrobatic youth who was the best
gymnast at the Hall, Joseph Hogan, usually
spoken of as Emerald on account of his Irish
brogue, and a score of others whom we shall meet
as our story progresses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>These were Jack and Pepper&rsquo;s friends. The
chums had also made some enemies, of whom the
worst was Dan Baxter, the bully of the school.
The bully at this time had two cronies almost as
bad as himself named Gus Coulter and Nick Paxton,
and also a toady, John Fenwick, called by all
the students Mumps.</p>
<p>Rivalries had been keen almost from the start,
and it had galled Dan Baxter exceedingly to see
Jack made major of the battalion, he himself having
plotted and schemed to obtain that honor,
but without avail. From that hour on the bully
did all he could to get Jack and his chum into
trouble. This at last led to a fight between the
bully and Jack, and the youthful major came out
practically a victor, although the fight was broken
off before it was finished. But Dan Baxter
boasted that he would yet whip Jack and whip
Pepper, too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>During the early part of the winter George
Strong, the second assistant teacher, had mysteriously
disappeared. Two strange men had been
seen around the Hall several times by Jack and
Pepper, and it was at last learned that the strange
men had something to do with the disappearance
of the assistant teacher. A hunt was instituted
by Captain Putnam, in which he was joined by
Jack, Pepper, Andy Snow, and Dale Blackmore.
The missing instructor was found a prisoner in
a cabin in the woods, his captors being the two
mysterious men, who proved to be relatives of
George Strong. They had lost their fortunes
and this had turned their brain, so that they were
not responsible for their doings. As soon as the
teacher was rescued, he sent the demented men
to the west, a relative from that part of the country
coming on to take them away.</p>
<p>George Strong had been very grateful to the
boys for what they had done for him, and he
did what he could to help them along in their
studies. The insane relatives had imagined that
the teacher had hidden away a fortune belonging
to the family. The teacher told the boys that it
was true that, during the Revolutionary War,
his ancestors had buried a pot of gold, to keep it
out of the hands of the British.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was not worth anything like a million,
as my unfortunate relatives believed,&rdquo; had been
George Strong&rsquo;s statement to Jack and Pepper.
&ldquo;At the most it would be worth eight or ten thousand
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a tidy sum,&rdquo; Jack had answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to pick up eight or ten thousand dollars,&rdquo;
Pepper had put in. &ldquo;Mr. Strong, have
you any idea where this fortune you speak of is
located?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very faint idea.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll tell us,&mdash;and the place is close by,&mdash;we
might look for it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A letter was left by my great-grandfather in
which the pot of gold was mentioned as resting at
the foot of the tree with the stone in its roots,
twenty paces north of the old well. I have never
been able to locate either the well or the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But was it around here?&rdquo; Jack had questioned
with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhere in this vicinity, for the farm belonging
to my great-grandfather was located not
many miles from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the Indians were here at that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they were, but my great-grandfather had
some Indian blood in his veins and was a frontiersman,
and the red men did not molest him
very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you ever hunted for the pot of gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great many times&mdash;years ago. But I at
last gave it up as useless. More than likely the
old well mentioned has fallen in and the tree
rotted away, so the landmarks are all gone and
nothing is left by which to locate the treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there the talk had come to an end, but the
boys had not forgotten about the pot of gold.</p>

<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">A GAME OF SNAP-THE-WHIP</span></h2>
<p>The race was on in earnest and the skates
flashed brightly in the rays of the declining
sun.</p>
<p>Pepper was in advance. Dale was slowly but
surely crawling up to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go it, Imp! go it!&rdquo; shrieked Jack, when he
saw that he could not win.</p>
<p>Pepper did &ldquo;go it,&rdquo; and despite Dale&rsquo;s effort
to get ahead kept to the front. In the meantime
Andy Snow also kept coming up, until he and
Dale were tied for second place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoop, Pepper has won!&rdquo; cried Stuffer
Singleton, who was bringing up the rear.
&ldquo;Where are you, Andy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo; answered the acrobatic pupil,
and just then struck a crack in the ice, went down,
and turned a handspring, coming to his feet again
like a flash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Would yez look at that now!&rdquo; burst out
Joseph Hogan, as he stopped racing to look at
Andy. &ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s in a circus you ought to
be,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy&rsquo;s doing stunts!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Stuffer, why didn&rsquo;t you try to win?&rdquo;
asked Andy, as he circled up to the stout youth.
&ldquo;Did you eat too much for dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat too much!&rdquo; snorted Stuffer. &ldquo;With old
Crabtree watching me? Not much! When I
asked for more meat he wouldn&rsquo;t let me have it.
And I think I got the smallest dish of dessert,
too!&rdquo; grumbled the youth who was fond of good
living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pepper, you are all right,&rdquo; said Jack, slapping
his chum on the back. &ldquo;That was well won!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do I get the pie?&rdquo; asked Pepper, with a
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly you do!&rdquo; came from several of the
others, who all loved the Imp. &ldquo;But you have
got to wait till we go to Cedarville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; if he&rsquo;ll be satisfied wid wan piece
he&rsquo;ll not have to wait at all, at all!&rdquo; came from
Hogan, with a twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what have you got up your sleeve,
Emerald?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not up me sleeve at all, but in me pocket,&rdquo;
answered the Irish lad, and hauled forth a piece
of brown paper containing a small cut of mince
pie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, where did you get that?&rdquo; asked several
of the others, in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got it from the kitchen, when nobody was
looking,&rdquo; answered Hogan. &ldquo;It was on the
table&mdash;set out, I think, for Snuggers&rsquo; dinner. I
didn&rsquo;t want to see him after gittin&rsquo; indigestion, so
I&mdash;well, I made an appropriation, as the politicians
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! I&rsquo;ll wager poor Peleg was mad!&rdquo; was
Pepper&rsquo;s comment. He referred to Peleg Snuggers,
the general-utility man around Putnam
Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So here you are, Imp,&rdquo; went on Hogan, and
held out the pie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason you proposed pie as a
prize, eh?&rdquo; cried Dale. &ldquo;Supposing you had
won?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I should have eaten the piece myself,&rdquo;
answered Emerald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll accept the pie on one condition,&rdquo; came
from Pepper. &ldquo;That is that you all have a bite
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will!&rdquo; was the shout, and a minute later
each lad present was chewing on his mouthful of
the dainty.</p>
<p>After that, the boys skated around for a little
while longer. There were others on the lake, but
they, for the most part, kept by themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see Dan Baxter is out, with a new pair of
skates,&rdquo; said Jack to Pepper, presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he has a new camera, too,&rdquo; answered
Pepper. &ldquo;By the way, I&rsquo;d like to have a camera
myself. I think I&rsquo;ll write home for one before
long. It will be lots of sport to take some winter
pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Pepper, with Andy, had skated a little
to one side, and now the three moved along one
of the shores, where grew some evergreens, now
loaded down with snow. The sun was going
down and it was growing dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, you!&rdquo; came suddenly from one side of
them. &ldquo;What do you mean by spoiling my picture!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three of the boys looked around and saw
that Dan Baxter had set up his tripod on the ice.
On the tripod rested his camera, the lens pointed
at the evergreens on the shore. The three boys
had swept along between the camera and the object
Baxter wished to photograph just as the picture
was being taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were trying to get a picture,
Dan,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know it?&rdquo; roared the bully of Putnam
Hall. &ldquo;Are you blind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then what did you rush in between for, tell
me that? I was trying to get a nice time picture,
and you have spoilt the plate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry. Haven&rsquo;t you got another
plate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I have. Do you think I carry only
one plate? But that&rsquo;s no reason why you and
Pep Ditmore and Andy Snow should act so
clownish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Baxter, but I didn&rsquo;t act clownish,&rdquo;
cried Pepper, circling up on his skates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see the camera at all,&rdquo; put in Andy
Snow. &ldquo;So please don&rsquo;t get so hot about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know you fellows!&rdquo; stormed Dan Baxter,
working himself up into a rage, as was often
his habit. &ldquo;You think you can ride over me.
But you can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are going to take a picture you had
better do it,&rdquo; said Jack, quietly. &ldquo;It will be too
dark in another ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t give me any advice, Jack Ruddy.
Just because you are the major this term you
can&rsquo;t boss me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not trying to boss you, as you call it,
Baxter. Come, why can&rsquo;t you drop the past and
be friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be friends with you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d rather have you for enemies any time,&rdquo;
came from Gus Coulter, who had been helping
his crony carry the photographing outfit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk,&rdquo; added Nick Paxton, who was
likewise present. &ldquo;We prefer to choose our own
friends; eh, fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we don&rsquo;t choose the Ruddy crowd,&rdquo; said
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, have your own way,&rdquo; answered
Jack, coldly. &ldquo;But it would be nicer the other
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t trust you, Ruddy, or trust your
friends either,&rdquo; remarked Dan Baxter, bitterly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d pretend to be friends and then get us
into a hole the first chance you got. I know
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You evidently judge us by yourself,&rdquo; said
Pepper, hotly. &ldquo;We are not so mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste any words on them,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;Come on and let them take their pictures,&rdquo; and
he skated away, and Jack and Pepper followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fellow Dan Baxter is!&rdquo; sighed the
youthful major of the cadets. &ldquo;No matter how
nice a fellow tries to be to him he seems to resent
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because he doesn&rsquo;t want us for friends,&rdquo;
answered Pepper. &ldquo;He prefers fellows like Coulter
and Paxton, and that sneak, Mumps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Just then a merry crowd of skaters swept along,
playing snap-the-whip. Our friends were invited
to join in, and the sport soon became so uproarious
that the bully and his associates were forgotten
for the time being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is where I live!&rdquo; ejaculated Pepper, as
he skated along. &ldquo;Come on, fellows, and snap
for keeps this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too fast!&rdquo; cried out Stuffer, who chanced
to be on the end at the time. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;can&rsquo;t keep
up, you&mdash;know!&rdquo; And then down he went on
the smooth ice and rolled over and over. Several
other skaters went down likewise, and a general
laugh arose. Then up the cadets leaped, to form
a new &ldquo;whip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only five minutes more!&rdquo; said Dale, consulting
a watch he carried. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t dare to be
late to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much, with old Crabtree on guard,&rdquo; answered
Pepper. &ldquo;If we are he&rsquo;ll be certain to
keep us in to-morrow for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I wish I had him out here on the ice,&rdquo;
was Dale&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; we&rsquo;d be after teachin&rsquo; him some foin
points,&rdquo; said Hogan. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d make him spread
th&rsquo; eagle on his head, so we would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crabtree knows enough to keep off the ice,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;Perhaps he can&rsquo;t skate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Strong is a beautiful skater,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;I saw him out day before yesterday. He
cut some very fancy figures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a difference between those two men,&rdquo;
said Andy. &ldquo;Just as much difference as between
Baxter and&mdash;and Joe Nelson,&rdquo; he added, naming
a quiet and steady pupil, well liked by all of the
cadets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, for the last swing!&rdquo; cried Jack.
&ldquo;Pepper, your turn on the end this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, but please don&rsquo;t snap me into the
middle of next week,&rdquo; answered the fun-loving
youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll snap you into the middle of next year!&rdquo;
cried Andy, gleefully. He wanted to square up
with somebody for a tumble he had taken.</p>
<p>Away went the boys, in a long line, across the
lake. All were shouting and cheering, the
hills beyond the lake echoing with their glee.
They did not attempt to make a sweep until all
had gained good headway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, all together!&rdquo; came from Dale.
&ldquo;Let her go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoop!&rdquo; shrieked Andy. &ldquo;Good-bye, Pepper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The long line began to sweep around. It was
fairly close to the lake shore, at a spot where there
was a point upon which grew a number of low
bushes, all thickly covered with snow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pepper is going into the snow this trip!&rdquo;
cried Dale, as the line broke, and Pepper was
hurled forward, flat on the smooth ice. But he
was mistaken. The boy turned over and over,
and then disappeared around the point like a
flash. The next instant there came a strange
crash, an exclamation of alarm, and then a babel
of voices raised in anger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">THE BULLY OF THE SCHOOL</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world is up now?&rdquo; ejaculated
Jack, as he started to skate around the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pepper is in trouble, that&rsquo;s sure,&rdquo; answered
Andy.</p>
<p>In a moment the boys who had been playing
snap-the-whip saw what had happened. Around
the point of land Dan Baxter had been trying
to take a time picture of the snow-laden bushes
and the rocks beyond&mdash;certainly an artistic bit of
landscape. Pepper, sprawling on the ice, had hit
the tripod and sent the camera crashing down
and the bully of Putnam Hall with it.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic2">
<img src="images/pic2.jpg" alt="SENT THE CAMERA CRASHING DOWN, AND THE BULLY" width="500" height="766" />
<p class="center small">SENT THE CAMERA CRASHING DOWN, AND THE BULLY</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; spluttered Dan Baxter, as he got
on his knees. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;er&mdash;see you!&rdquo; gasped Pepper.
The wind had been knocked completely out
of him by the unexpected contact with camera,
tripod, and owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s false!&rdquo; cried the bully. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t
help seeing me! It&rsquo;s all a bluff!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;er&mdash;you&rsquo;re mistaken,&rdquo; panted Pepper,
and started to rise, when the bully caught him
by the collar and pulled him flat again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go of me, Dan Baxter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not! I am going to teach you a good
lesson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi! What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, skating
closer. &ldquo;Let go of him, Baxter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t to blame,&rdquo; put in Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the truth av it,&rdquo; broke in
Emerald. &ldquo;We all had a hand, so we did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were playing snap-the-whip,&rdquo; explained
Dale. &ldquo;You must have seen us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I don&rsquo;t watch such childish
games,&rdquo; sneered the bully. &ldquo;I was tending to
my own business when he comes along, smashes
the camera, and knocks me down. Do you think
I am going to stand for that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stand if you are knocked down,&rdquo;
said Andy, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Don&rsquo;t get funny, Snow! This is
no laughing matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the dentist said when he pulled the wrong
tooth,&rdquo; came softly from Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the camera really broken?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is, and it cost my dad twenty-five
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can get one like it for twelve,&rdquo; said Stuffer.
&ldquo;Same size and make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is broken,&rdquo; said Jack, looking
the box over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard something crack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was the glass plate. The lens and
shutter are certainly O. K., and the box is
tight too. One leg of the tripod is broken
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pepper Ditmore has got to pay for this,&rdquo; came
firmly from Dan Baxter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, don&rsquo;t let him crawl out of it,&rdquo;
put in Gus Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too smart altogether,&rdquo; added Nick
Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Coulter, don&rsquo;t you put in your oar,&rdquo;
cried Pepper. &ldquo;If you do, I&rsquo;ll give you what I
gave you before.&rdquo; And then Gus Coulter slunk
back, for he had not forgotten the drubbing
Pepper had administered but a few weeks previous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to pay for the damage done or
not?&rdquo; demanded Dan Baxter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall certainly pay,&rdquo; said Pepper, promptly.
&ldquo;Let me have the camera and I&rsquo;ll get it fixed.
Or you can have it fixed and have the bill sent to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all pay the bill,&rdquo; cried Jack. &ldquo;I think
I am as much to blame as Pep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; added Andy, and many of the
others who had been playing snap-the-whip said
the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to let you have my camera,&rdquo;
said Dan Baxter, sulkily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get it mended as
it should be.&rdquo; He paused a moment. &ldquo;But I
ain&rsquo;t going to let you knock me down for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I explained, it was an accident, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! You ought to be made to apologize,&rdquo;
growled the bully. He would have attacked
Pepper, only he realized that the lad had
too many friends around.</p>
<p>A war of words followed, lasting several minutes.
Then of a sudden one of the boys let out
a low whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five minutes over time, fellows. We must
get back to the Hall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five minutes late!&rdquo; came the cry. &ldquo;This
won&rsquo;t do at all! Come on and get back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the majority ran off, leaving
Pepper and Jack with Dan Baxter and Gus
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get back to the Hall, Baxter,&rdquo; said
Pepper. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll settle to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;for I&rsquo;ll make you settle,&rdquo; answered the
bully, meaningly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stood all I&rsquo;m going
to stand from you and your cronies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So speaking the bully picked up his camera and
hurried away, followed by Gus Coulter with the
case containing the plates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry this happened,&rdquo; observed Jack, as
he and Pepper ran for the mess-hall. &ldquo;This will
make Baxter more down on us than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it, Jack. I did what I could
to steer clear of the bushes. I didn&rsquo;t want to
scratch my face, and I didn&rsquo;t know he was back
there out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Jack and Pepper reached the Hall they
were met by Josiah Crabtree, who viewed them
sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this, Major Ruddy?&rdquo;
demanded the first assistant teacher. &ldquo;You are
setting a bad example for those under you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a little trouble on the ice,&rdquo; answered
Jack. &ldquo;Pepper fell down and knocked over Dan
Baxter&rsquo;s camera, and we had to straighten matters
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! See that you are not late again,&rdquo;
muttered the teacher, and passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! we got off easily that time,&rdquo; exclaimed
Pepper, in a low tone. &ldquo;He must have something
else to attend to,&rdquo; and in this surmise the youth
was correct.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>A drum was already rolling, and the boys were
hurrying to the parade ground. Jack dashed in
and got his sword, and Pepper got his gun, and
both hurried to the parade ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Battalion, attention!&rdquo; commanded the youthful
major, and soon the cadets were in line. Then
came a short drill, followed by the order to march.
The drums sounded out, the fifes struck up a
lively air, and around the parade ground went the
cadets, and at last marched into the mess-hall,
where they all sat down to a plain but substantial
supper.</p>
<p>During the meal Pepper and Jack saw Dan
Baxter scowl at them, and both felt that the bully
&ldquo;had it in for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is bound to get square,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Pep,
we must keep our eyes peeled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After supper the boys had an hour off. Some
spent the time in the library reading, while others
drifted into the gymnasium.</p>
<p>Jack had some studies to attend to, and went
to an open classroom. Pepper walked to the
gymnasium, accompanied by Andy Snow.</p>
<p>Both boys were soon exercising on the rings,
and Andy showed what he could do on a turning
bar,&mdash;doing the &ldquo;giant swing&rdquo; and other difficult
feats.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>While they were exercising, Mumps, the toady
to Dan Baxter, came in, followed by a new student
named Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>Reff Ritter was a youth who had a very high
opinion of himself. His parents were fairly well
off and the boy had traveled a good deal in foreign
countries. Reff had an idea that he could
do almost anything, and he loved to boast of his
ability and also to boast of where he had been and
what he had seen. A few of the boys, including
Mumps, toadied to him, but the majority voted
the newcomer &ldquo;a pill.&rdquo; He had tried to become
friendly with Jack and Pepper, but both had tired
of his everlasting boastings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a gymnast?&rdquo; asked Mumps, as he
and Reff Ritter came to a halt close to where
Andy and Pepper were practicing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, certainly!&rdquo; exclaimed Ritter, in a loud
voice. &ldquo;I took some lessons in New York and I
finished up while I was in London and Berlin. A
German instructor&mdash;one of the <i>Turn-verein</i> men&mdash;taught
me a lot of tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; went on Mumps,
as Andy made a swing on the rings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair, only fair,&rdquo; drawled Reff Ritter. &ldquo;Not
at all graceful. Now when I was stopping at
Madrid, there was a Spaniard there who showed
me how to do a turn like that, and it was perfection,
I can assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>Andy heard the remark, and it made his ears
tingle. He gave a swing and landed on the floor
in front of Ritter and Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see that Spanish swing you just
mentioned,&rdquo; he said, coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I didn&rsquo;t&mdash;er&mdash;calculate to do anything
in the way of gymnastics this evening,&rdquo;
stammered Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you are afraid to try,&rdquo; went on Andy,
pointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all! not at all!&rdquo; exclaimed the new
student. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you how to do it if you want
me to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took off his coat and vest and also his collar
and tie. Then he leaped up on the rings and
began to swing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here goes!&rdquo; he called out, and made the turn,
while a small crowd began to gather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! That&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; called out Mumps.
&ldquo;Now, Andy Snow, how do you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The turn had been a fairly good one. Andy
smiled quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you make the double turn?&rdquo; he called up
to Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;I learned that in Berlin also,&rdquo; was
the answer, and the turn was made, after a good
deal of an effort. Then, warming up, Reff Ritter
began to show off, doing about everything he had
ever learned. He did not stop until he was practically
out of breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>Taken as a whole, it was a fair exhibition of
gymnastic work, and some of the boys standing
around applauded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you finished?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; answered Reff Ritter. He caught
his breath. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a pattern for your friend
to go by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, but I don&rsquo;t need any pattern,&rdquo; answered
Andy. &ldquo;Here goes for another try at
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went up lightly and began to perform.
First he did several things which were comparatively
easy. But each turn was clean-cut in itself
and decidedly graceful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy certainly knows how to go at it,&rdquo; remarked
Joe Nelson, who was present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! He hasn&rsquo;t done anything as difficult
as I did,&rdquo; put in Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>Then Andy began to do other things, making
swings and leaps that were really wonderful in
one who was only an amateur. The boys applauded
more and more. Then he made a leap
and a twist seldom seen outside of a regular circus
performance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo; cried Pepper, enthusiastically.
&ldquo;Nobody can do better!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; Andy&rsquo;s the bist acrobat in the school,
so he is,&rdquo; said Emerald.</p>
<p>And the majority of those standing around
agreed with the Irish cadet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">A DOSE OF SNOW AND ICICLES</span></h2>
<p>As soon as it became apparent that Andy was
doing much better than he had been able to do,
Reff Ritter lost interest in the exhibition going
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;ve seen enough,&rdquo; he drawled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
cold in here anyway. I&rsquo;m going back to the
school,&rdquo; and he shuffled off, followed by Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy, you are ten times better than he is on
the bar and rings,&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, an&rsquo; that Ritter is a big blow, so he is!&rdquo;
was Hogan&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;I am glad that Andy
took him down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll like it much,&rdquo; observed
Andy.</p>
<p>The acrobatic youth was right. Reff Ritter
was very bitter at heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are Baxter and Coulter?&rdquo; he asked of
Mumps, as they hurried outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went down to the old boathouse,&rdquo; and
Mumps winked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For a smoke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the whispered answer. For, as my
readers may imagine, smoking among the cadets
was strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think I&rsquo;ll have a cigarette myself,&rdquo; said Ritter.
&ldquo;Will you come along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, Mumps did not like to smoke, as it made
him sick. But he did not wish to offend his new
friend, and so he agreed to go along. They
soon made their way to where Baxter and Coulter
had taken themselves, and the toady gave a peculiar
whistle.</p>
<p>It was answered a moment later, and Coulter
appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All right, come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They entered a section of the old boathouse
that was but little used. It would have been cold,
only the cadets had found a charcoal stove, and
this was burning. Around it were Dan Baxter,
Paxton, and Coulter, all smoking cigarettes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, glad to see you,&rdquo; said Dan Baxter to
Reff Ritter. &ldquo;Sit down with us and enjoy yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ritter sat down and drew from his pocket a
package of imported cigarettes. He offered one
to Mumps, and the toady lit it. Then Ritter lit
one himself, inhaling the smoke and blowing it
forth through his nose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is something like,&rdquo; he observed.
&ldquo;Quite a cozy bunk you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good enough for a smoking place in the
winter time,&rdquo; answered the bully of Putnam Hall.
&ldquo;In the summer time we can go anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam must be down on smoking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why,&rdquo; said Paxton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve smoked
ever since I was eight years old.&rdquo; And his
pinched face showed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love these imported Egyptian cigarettes,&rdquo;
went on Reff Ritter. &ldquo;I get the genuine, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a treat for all hands,&rdquo; said Dan Baxter,
after a pause. He brought forth a big bottle
from his overcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wine&mdash;I bought it down at Cedarville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the stuff!&rdquo; exclaimed Ritter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with
you on wine. I got used to drinking it when I
was over in Europe. You know they serve it
regularly for dinner at all the hotels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bottle of wine was passed around, and all
of the boys assembled drank a portion. Mumps
wanted to decline, but did not dare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid of it, Mumpsy, old boy,&rdquo; said
Baxter to his toady. &ldquo;Drink it, it will make a
man of you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>The boys continued to smoke and drink for the
best part of half an hour. Then they heard a
peculiar noise outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, somebody is coming!&rdquo; cried Paxton, in
alarm. &ldquo;Put out the light!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lantern that hung on a nail was extinguished
and the boys listened. They heard somebody
moving around in the dark. Then all became
silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like this,&rdquo; said Mumps, in a trembling
voice. &ldquo;I think somebody was spying on
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had better get back to the school,&rdquo; said
Baxter, and this advice was followed without delay.
They saw somebody running across the
campus, but could not make out who the person
was.</p>
<p>During the time the Baxter crowd had been
smoking and drinking they had talked over many
matters, and particularly their troubles with Pepper,
Jack, and Andy Snow. The bully of the
Hall wanted to get even with Pepper for the
trouble on the ice, and Reff Ritter was willing
to do almost anything to &ldquo;put a spoke in Andy
Snow&rsquo;s wheel,&rdquo; as he expressed it.</p>
<p>The upshot of the talk was that the crowd
determined to play some tricks on our friends,
and do it that very night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know something brand-new,&rdquo; said Coulter,
and told his cronies of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk&mdash;if we can work it,&rdquo; said Baxter.
&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll do something else, too,&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>Gus Coulter&rsquo;s idea was to get some snow and
stuff it into the pillows of the other boys. The
heat of the boys&rsquo; heads would gradually melt the
snow and leave the lads in beds that were soaking
wet.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, Dan Baxter and his
party found the dormitory occupied by Jack and
the others empty when they went upstairs. They
quickly got out the bed pillows, and from the
roof of an addition to the academy procured the
necessary snow, which they stuffed into the pillow-cases,
next to the feathers. Then they got
a number of icicles and put several at the foot of
each bed, under the blankets, and in such manner
that the boys&rsquo; feet would come up against them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now for a finishing touch,&rdquo; said Ritter,
and placed a big chunk of snow on the upper edge
of the dormitory door, leaving the door slightly
open. Then the boys hid away to watch proceedings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>It was not long after this that Jack and his
friends came upstairs to go to bed. They did not,
however, go straight to their dormitory, but
stopped to talk to some other cadets at the end of
the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish they would go in their room,&rdquo; whispered
Paxton, from a corner. &ldquo;I am getting tired
of waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, here comes old Crabtree,&rdquo; put in
Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he&rsquo;s going toward their room!&rdquo;
cried Gus Coulter, in surprise.</p>
<p>He spoke the truth, and an instant later Josiah
Crabtree pushed upon the dormitory door. Down
came the big chunk of snow on the teacher, sending
him flat to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi! What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; spluttered Josiah
Crabtree. &ldquo;Who is&mdash;er&mdash;who covered me with
snow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned over and got to his feet. His
shoulders were full of snow and some snow had
gone down inside his collar, causing him to shiver
with cold.</p>
<p>The noise attracted the attention of all the
cadets in the vicinity, and soon they gathered
around the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Crabtree is taking a snow bath for his
health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did all that snow come from?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Major Ruddy, can you explain this?&rdquo; demanded
the assistant teacher, turning angrily to
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I cannot,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to enter this dormitory when
down came this snow, almost burying me alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, Mr. Crabtree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is outrageous&mdash;villainous! Somebody is
responsible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not. I know nothing about the snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it was put there for our benefit,&rdquo; put
in Pepper. &ldquo;We were about to enter the room
when you came along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! A silly trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you happen to catch it, Mr. Crabtree?&rdquo;
asked Andy, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going into the room to see if the windows
were closed. There is a great draught
through this hallway, as you can feel. Then you
do not know who did this?&rdquo; went on the instructor,
gazing sharply at the assembled pupils.</p>
<p>All looked blankly at each other. Dan Baxter
and his cronies took good care to keep in the background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gather up the snow and throw it out of a
window,&rdquo; ordered Josiah Crabtree, and this was
done, but not before several snowballs had been
thrown, one catching Mumps in the neck and another
landing on Reff Ritter&rsquo;s left ear. Then the
throwing was stopped, order was restored, and all
of the cadets were told to retire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody put up a job on us right enough,&rdquo;
observed Pepper, when he and his chums were in
the dormitory and the door had been closed. &ldquo;If
old Crabtree hadn&rsquo;t come along one of us would
have gotten that dose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager that I know who is guilty,&rdquo; came
from Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan Baxter and his crowd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Didn&rsquo;t you see how they hung back
and how they grinned at us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it,&rdquo; came from Andy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I
soaked Mumps with a snowball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I let Ritter have it in the ear,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;But I say, fellows, we want to be on our
guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they played more jokes on us?&rdquo;
questioned Hogan. &ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; it would be just
like &rsquo;em to do it, so it would!&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly won&rsquo;t do any harm to look
around,&rdquo; suggested Jack. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take but a
few minutes to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pepper held up his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he whispered, and sliding to the door,
threw it open suddenly. Outside he found Ritter,
Baxter, and Coulter. The trio were amazed
at being thus suddenly confronted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so!&rdquo; cried Pepper, triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go to grass!&rdquo; muttered the bully of the
school, and walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix you another time,&rdquo; muttered Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do it well too,&rdquo; added Coulter.</p>
<p>Pepper waited until he had seen the others enter
their dormitory and then closed his own door
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found something!&rdquo; cried Andy, and dove
into his pillow-case. &ldquo;Filled with snow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snow for Snow!&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a cold pun,&rdquo; observed Dale. &ldquo;Just the
same, here is snow in my pillow too. Say, we
just got this in time. It would have melted before
long and then our pillows would have been
wringing wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say a word about snow,&rdquo; said Emerald.
&ldquo;Just be after lookin&rsquo; at this now!&rdquo; And he held
up three icicles he had dislodged from his bed.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t they iligant foot-warmers though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without delay the other boys looked into their
beds, and soon all the icicles were disposed of,
and the snow was likewise cleaned away. They
then made another hunt around the dormitory, to
make certain that nothing else was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we are safe now,&rdquo; said Jack, at last.
&ldquo;But what a mess this would have made if we
had not found it out in time!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I am going to do,&rdquo; said Pepper,
decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Imp?&rdquo; came from several of the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to pay the Baxter crowd back, and
with interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the others instantly agreed to help him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">THE DOCTORED CAKE</span></h2>
<p>Two days later Pepper and Andy were out on
the lake skating, when Andy broke his skate and
pitched flat on the ice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, what are you doing?&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking to see how thick the ice is,&rdquo; was the
merry retort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you were looking for stars,&rdquo; went
on the Imp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thanks, I didn&rsquo;t go down on the back of
my head. Just the same, my left skate is broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both of the boys looked the broken skate over,
and then retired to the old boathouse to see if
they could not fix it. By chance they entered the
place which Dan Baxter&rsquo;s crowd had been using
from time to time as a rendezvous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, look here!&rdquo; cried Pepper, gazing
around. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that anybody came
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did I.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here are lots of cigarette butts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Pep, and&mdash;look in the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pepper looked in the direction pointed out.
From under a pile of old leaves, which the wind
had blown into the boathouse when the door was
open, shone the neck of a bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wine bottle, I declare, Andy. Can it be
that some of the fellows have been drinking down
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It looks a little like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that is against the rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is smoking, and those butts look to be
pretty fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were mystified, but could not answer
the question which arose in their minds. They
looked around for what they were after, but could
not mend the broken skate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to take it down to Cedarville and
have it mended,&rdquo; said the acrobatic youth.
&ldquo;Maybe I can get off to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll lend you a pair, Andy. I
have two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Pep. But I like this pair. They
just fit my feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not until the following Tuesday that
Pepper, Andy, and Jack got permission to visit
Cedarville, the nearest steamboat town on the lake
to Putnam Hall. In the meantime, on Monday,
Dale and Hogan came to them in some little excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have got news,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan Baxter is going to celebrate,&rdquo; added the
Irish cadet. &ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s going to have an iligant
spread, so he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is he going to celebrate?&rdquo; asked Pepper,
with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got a big allowance from home&mdash;smuggled
it past Captain Putnam, too,&rdquo; explained Dale.
&ldquo;As a consequence, he is going to give the fellows
of his dormitory a feast, or something like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you learn all this?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By accident. Baxter passed a note to Paxton,
who dropped it. I thought it was some plot
against us, and read the note. Then I heard Paxton
telling Billy Sabine. Baxter is going to make
it the biggest spread ever given in this school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is our chance to get even with him!&rdquo;
cried Pepper, his eyes dancing. &ldquo;We ought to
doctor up that feast for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we do it?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll think up something before the time
comes,&rdquo; answered the Imp. &ldquo;When does it come
off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wednesday night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>This was all Dale and Emerald could tell, and
a minute later Jack, Pepper, and Andy entered
the classroom for the afternoon session.</p>
<p>It was not until after school on Tuesday that
the three boys started for Cedarville. It was
rather a long distance, but they did not mind it.
They skated part of the way on the lake and then
took to the wagon-road.</p>
<p>Cedarville was not a large place, but it boasted
of some rather good stores, and also a blacksmith
shop and several churches. The cadets went to
the churches from time to time and were fairly
well known to all of the storekeepers.</p>
<p>Having left the broken skate where it could be
mended, Andy and his chums walked around the
town and made several small purchases. Coming
out of one of the stores they met a farmer whom
they knew, he having delivered potatoes and other
vegetables at the Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Mr. Shepard?&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, boys?&rdquo; answered the farmer.
&ldquo;Visitin&rsquo; town, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re out hunting elephants,&rdquo; answered
Pepper, with a grin.</p>
<p>At this the farmer, who was a good-natured
man, laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got to have your joke, I see,&rdquo; he observed.
&ldquo;How be you gettin&rsquo; on at school?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bang-up,&rdquo; answered Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam is a powerful good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we all like the captain,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;How are matters at your farm this winter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kind o&rsquo; slow. Had some of the boys over
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A feller named Baxter and two friends. They
come fer some apples an&rsquo; cider an&rsquo; some other
things. Got my wife to cook a turkey fer &rsquo;em
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we know something about that
spread,&rdquo; said Jack, carelessly. &ldquo;He is going to
give some of the boys something great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you delivered the stuff yet?&rdquo; asked
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to at supper time to-morrow night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at the academy?&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he said it was to be a surprise on everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On some of the fellows,&rdquo; corrected Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to leave the stuff somewhere
for him, I suppose,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;outside the grounds&mdash;at seven sharp,&rdquo;
answered Amos Shepard, and then as a farmhand
came along, he walked away with the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is certainly news,&rdquo; was Pepper&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;Boys, we must get hold of that stuff if
we can do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;But how is
it to be done? We don&rsquo;t know where Mr. Shepard
will leave it, and it won&rsquo;t do to ask him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that would make him suspicious,&rdquo; said
Andy. &ldquo;But I know what we can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sneak out on the road that runs from his farm
over to the Hall. When he comes along we can
watch and see where he goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;Just the very
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The walking had made the boys hungry, and
before starting on the return to the Hall they
entered the main bakery of Cedarville, to get some
cakes and a small pie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, there&rsquo;s a big cake for you!&rdquo; cried Pepper,
pointing to one that had just been placed on
a back shelf. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t mind a slice of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll get a slice of it,&rdquo; said the baker,
rubbing his hands together and smiling in a meaning
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked Andy, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you wait and see,&rdquo; said the baker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can that be a cake Dan Baxter ordered?&rdquo;
whispered Jack to his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; said Pepper. He followed the baker
to the back of the shop. &ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s Baxter&rsquo;s
cake, eh?&rdquo; he whispered into the man&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>The baker winked suggestively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he coming for it, or are you going to send
it to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me not to say anything about it to
anybody,&rdquo; replied the baker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Well, I won&rsquo;t ask questions then.
Don&rsquo;t say anything about our being here,&rdquo; went
on Pepper. &ldquo;It might hurt his feelings, if he
knew we had seen the cake before he showed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t say a word,&rdquo; answered the baker.</p>
<p>The boys paid for their purchases and quitted
the bakery, and looking through the window they
saw the baker leave the shop to go to work at his
oven, which was in the cellar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if only we could doctor that cake!&rdquo; murmured
Pepper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a dollar to be able to
do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The icing on the top was soft,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a raisin cake,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;A few stones
in place of some raisins wouldn&rsquo;t go bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a little pepper would give it an extra
flavor,&rdquo; said Pepper, with a wink. &ldquo;Come
on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran to the nearest grocery store and there
procured some strong red pepper. In the meantime
Andy found a cleared spot in a sunny corner
of the village and got a handful of sand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>The three boys walked back to the vicinity of
the bakery. The baker was not in sight. But
there was a bell on his door, which rang out
sharply every time the door was opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go in by the door,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;He
will come at once, as soon as the bell rings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a side window&mdash;let us try that,&rdquo; said
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing he comes?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can buy some more cakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The window opened out on a lane and was
located close to the shelf upon which rested the
cake. They found the lower sash unfastened and
raised it cautiously. Then all three hopped into
the bakery and stepped over to where the cake
rested.</p>
<p>It took but a few minutes to fill the cake with
pepper and fine sand. This done, they smoothed
down the half-soft icing with the blade of a
pocketknife. Just as they were finishing the
work they heard footsteps on the stairs in the
rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick&mdash;out you go!&rdquo; cried Pepper, and
cleared the window, followed by his chums.
Then they put down the sash and ran off, without
the baker catching sight of them or having
any idea of what had been done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That cake will taste fine,&rdquo; said Andy, with a
laugh, when they were on their way back to the
Hall. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Dan Baxter and his crowd enjoy
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll want to hang us if they find us out,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must take good care that they don&rsquo;t find
us out,&rdquo; came from Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, if we can only locate the things Mr.
Shepard is going to bring over,&rdquo; went on Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to lay hold of the turkey,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;Yum! yum! I wouldn&rsquo;t do a thing to that bird!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ditto here!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;Oh, we must
locate the turkey by all means&mdash;and some bread
and butter. Think of nice turkey sandwiches!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a few apples!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus talking of what more they intended to
do, the three cadets hurried back to Putnam Hall
with all possible speed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">THE BASKET IN THE TREE</span></h2>
<p>Supper was served at Putnam Hall in the winter
time at six o&rsquo;clock, and as a general thing the
meal was over inside of half an hour, when the
cadets had an hour or more to themselves.</p>
<p>On the following day, after supper, Jack and
the others watched Dan Baxter and his cronies
closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emerald, you and Dale stop them about seven
o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; said Pepper, and to this the two cadets
agreed.</p>
<p>The Irish lad and Dale kept a close eye on Dan
Baxter, who was with Coulter and Reff Ritter.
At a few minutes to seven the bully and his
cronies started away from the Hall in the direction
of a side road&mdash;that leading past the Shepard
farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is where we hold &rsquo;em up a bit,&rdquo; said
Dale, and ran forward calling loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; asked the bully, stopping
short, with a scowl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; said Dale, and walked up
slowly, while Hogan did the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be all night about it,&rdquo; put in Reff
Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this report I heard to-day?&rdquo; said Dale,
facing the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What report?&rdquo; asked Baxter, suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Baxter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say I do not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that race on the ice, and all that,&rdquo; said
Hogan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer tale, so it is! Didn&rsquo;t yez
hear all about it at Cedarville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither have I,&rdquo; put in Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Coulter knows about it,&rdquo; went on
Dale. &ldquo;He usually knows everything. Did you
see the horse?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse?&rdquo; asked Gus Coulter, puzzled.
&ldquo;What in the world are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That horse they brought into the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see any horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly he was a beauty,&rdquo; said Hogan, with
a broad laugh. &ldquo;All painted with that red paint,
too. Where did that paint come from, answer
me that now?&rdquo; he demanded, in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about a horse or any
red paint either,&rdquo; growled Dan Baxter. &ldquo;Is this
a joke?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to that!&rdquo; cried Dale. &ldquo;Say, you can
put on a good front, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you don&rsquo;t know about that ghost business
either,&rdquo; came from Hogan. &ldquo;Very innocent,
so ye are, I must say!&rdquo; And he winked with
his left eye in a most mysterious manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, you are talking Greek to me!&rdquo;
roared Baxter. He was anxious to get away.
&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t explain I don&rsquo;t want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emerald, perhaps they don&rsquo;t know after all,&rdquo;
whispered Dale, but in such a manner that the
bully and his friends could hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be gorry, I hope we haven&rsquo;t put our foot into
it thin!&rdquo; muttered the Irish cadet. He walked
up to Reff Ritter. &ldquo;Say, forget it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget what?&rdquo; demanded Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I was after telling you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told me nothing yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so now? Then so much the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re trying to fool us!&rdquo; burst out Dan
Baxter. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to listen to another
word,&rdquo; and he turned away, and his friends followed
him. Dale and Hogan waited a minute
and then went back to the Hall, so that the bully
and his cronies might not get too suspicious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We held &rsquo;em up ten minutes,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;I
hope that helped Pepper and the others out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>In the meantime Pepper, Andy, and Jack left
the Hall by a roundabout way and hurried along
the road leading to the Shepard farm. It was
quite dark and rather cold, although there was
but little wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a carriage coming!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack,
presently. &ldquo;Step back of the bushes and see who
is driving it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others complied, and soon the carriage
came up. On the seat driving was Amos Shepard,
and at his feet rested a big square basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes,&rdquo; exclaimed Pepper, when the
farmer had passed. &ldquo;Let us follow him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an easy matter to follow the carriage,
for the road was rocky and the farmer had to
drive slowly. Coming to a turn, the man in the
carriage dismounted and placed the big basket in
a crotch of a tree. Then he went on his way to
Cedarville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick&mdash;there is no time to lose!&rdquo; exclaimed
Pepper. &ldquo;Dan Baxter may come for this basket
at any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They soon had the basket out of the crotch of
the tree and examined the contents. There were
the stuffed turkey, nicely cooked, some fresh biscuit,
two pies, some apples, a jug of cider, and
some other things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll appropriate a pie and some biscuits and
apples, and likewise a bit of the turkey,&rdquo; said
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; warned Jack. &ldquo;If you muss the
turkey up Baxter will suspect something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix that easily enough,&rdquo; came from the resourceful
Pepper.</p>
<p>Having taken what they wanted, the boys proceeded
to &ldquo;season&rdquo; what remained with the pepper
and with some lard and vinegar Andy had procured
on the sly from the academy kitchen. They
had brought some napkins with them, and in these
placed what they had appropriated. Then Pepper
calmly proceeded to break down one of the
tree limbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing that for?&rdquo; asked
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; said Pepper, calmly, and under
the broken-down limb he placed the basket, resting
on its side. &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First-rate!&rdquo; laughed Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks exactly as if the basket had been on the
limb and it had broken and spilt the stuff,&rdquo; said
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll get out of sight and watch,&rdquo; went
on the Imp.</p>
<p>They ran out of sight and waited. Not five
minutes later Dan Baxter, Coulter, and Ritter
hove into sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the spot, fellows,&rdquo; they heard the bully
of the Hall exclaim. &ldquo;Anybody around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anybody,&rdquo; answered Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the basket?&rdquo; asked Coulter, gazing
up into the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here it is, on the ground,&rdquo; said Baxter. &ldquo;Too
bad, it&rsquo;s tumbled over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The limb broke down with it, it was so
heavy,&rdquo; said Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>Baxter got down and struck a match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stuff is pretty well tumbled around,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;And, say&mdash;some of the turkey is gone!&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe some animal came up and took it,&rdquo;
suggested Coulter. &ldquo;I thought I saw a dog on
the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to eat after a dog,&rdquo; said Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I reckon it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Baxter,
hastily. He did not want anything to occur to
spoil the grandness of his proposed spread. To
his cronies he had boasted that this was to be the
finest spread ever given on the sly at Putnam
Hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>Taking up the basket, the bully rearranged the
things. He noticed that there was not as much
as he had ordered, and made up his mind to
&ldquo;pitch into&rdquo; Amos Shepard when next they should
meet. He and Coulter carried the basket and
Ritter the jug of cider, and off they went to the
Hall, entering unobserved by a back way, and
sneaking to their dormitory, where the goodies
were hidden in a clothes closet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, wait till to-night!&rdquo; said Pepper, as he and
his chums also returned.</p>
<p>The evening seemed to drag after that, so many
were waiting for bedtime to come. Baxter tried
to learn from Dale what the talk earlier in the
evening had meant, but got no satisfaction.</p>
<p>All of the boys of the bully&rsquo;s dormitory had
been invited to the feast and also some other
cadets, making a total of sixteen lads who were to
participate. They were all followers of Dan
Baxter, and but few of them were liked by the
other cadets.</p>
<p>At last it was time to go to bed, and one after
another the boys went off. Our friends undressed
and then slipped on some warm coats
over their night garments. Soon the monitors
came around to see that everything was as it
should be for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is our time,&rdquo; whispered Pepper. &ldquo;Baxter&rsquo;s
crowd will be stirring soon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>With caution they left their dormitory and
stole along the hallway. As luck would have it,
there was a room next to the Baxter dormitory
that was vacant, the plaster having fallen and
being not yet repaired. The door was unlocked
and our friends entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Pepper, as they all came close
to a door which communicated with the next
dormitory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, fellows, we&rsquo;ll have the finest feast you
ever saw at any school,&rdquo; they heard Dan Baxter
say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll carve the turkey and you, Coulter, can
cut the cake, and Mumps can pour out the cider.
After the cider we&rsquo;ll have something a little
stronger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they have anything hotter than
that cider,&rdquo; murmured Pepper.</p>
<p>Those outside of the room heard the bully and
his cronies make numerous preparations for the
feast. Then the stuff was passed around and all
prepared to do full justice to what was handed to
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all right,&rdquo; exclaimed Reff Ritter, as
he bit into a turkey sandwich. &ldquo;Say, wouldn&rsquo;t it
make Jack Ruddy and his crowd feel sore to know
about these good things we are having!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this sandwich is pretty warm,&rdquo; came
from Paxton. &ldquo;Phew! but it&rsquo;s hot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s cold, Nick,&rdquo; answered the bully of
the Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it? Not much! It&rsquo;s full of pepper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; came from Mumps. &ldquo;Oh, my tooth!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with it?&rdquo; asked Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bitten on something hard. Guess it was
a stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Creation, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; came from Ritter.
&ldquo;Say, Dan, this smells like vinegar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another boy was drinking some cider. He
made a wry face and ejected the liquid from his
mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst cider I ever tasted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see!&rdquo; cried Dan Baxter, and caught
up a glassful. He took one swallow and began to
breathe heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;pep&mdash;peppery!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Oh,
my insides are burning up! Somebody give me
some water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whow! The cake is peppery, too!&rdquo; came
from another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And full of sand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This piece of celery has got lard all over
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the worst sandwich I ever tried to
eat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This apple is full of vinegar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is this currant jelly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows, somebody has played a trick on
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t eat any more of the stuff. It may be
poisoned!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; groaned Mumps, turning
pale. &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to be poisoned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who touched this stuff?&rdquo; gasped Dan
Baxter. He was so angry he could hardly speak.</p>
<p>No one could answer the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I ever find out who did it, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll skin
&rsquo;em alive, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing is certain,&rdquo; said Reff Ritter, in deep
disgust. &ldquo;All of the stuff was fixed up, and
there will be no feast to-night, that is sure. I
wouldn&rsquo;t touch another mouthful for a thousand
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to find out who did this,&rdquo; said Baxter,
starting up. &ldquo;And I am going to find out
to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">IN THE CLASSROOM</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for us to get out!&rdquo; whispered Jack
to his chums. &ldquo;Baxter is going on a rampage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To our dormitory!&rdquo; whispered Andy, and led
the way on tiptoes. The others followed, and in
less than a minute they were safe in their room
with the door tightly closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had better get into bed for the
present,&rdquo; suggested Stuffer Singleton. &ldquo;Baxter
may come this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was considered good advice, and it did
not take them long to put out the light that had
been lit and get into bed. With ears on the alert
they awaited developments.</p>
<p>They were not long in coming. Footsteps
sounded in the hallway, and then they heard some
whispered conversation in front of their door.
Pepper wanted to laugh outright and had all he
could do to hold in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear them,&rdquo; came softly in Dan Baxter&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are foxy,&rdquo; answered Ritter.</p>
<p>The door was tried and Dan Baxter looked into
the room. He could see next to nothing in the
almost total darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; asked Andy, sleepily.
&ldquo;Is it time to&mdash;to get up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A grunt from Dan Baxter was the only response,
and then the door was closed again, and
they heard Baxter and some others moving away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Andy, that was rich!&rdquo; whispered Pepper,
and gave a low laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stir too much yet,&rdquo; cautioned Jack.
&ldquo;They may come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to the door to watch,&rdquo; answered
Pepper. &ldquo;If they come this way again I can
crawl back to bed in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing at the door, which he held on a crack,
the Imp saw Baxter and several others move
from one dormitory to another, listening and spying
at every door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheese it, here comes Mr. Strong!&rdquo; he heard
Coulter say, a short while later, and off the bully&rsquo;s
crowd scampered to their rooms. Then the second
assistant teacher came up the stairs and
Pepper hurried back to his bed. George Strong
looked around the hallway and walked to several
dormitories, and then passed on to the third floor
of the building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will they come back again?&rdquo; asked Andy,
after a long spell of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better wait a while longer and see,&rdquo; said
Hogan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m itching to get at that stuff,&rdquo; came, with
a sigh, from Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever know a time that you wasn&rsquo;t
hungry, Stuffer?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I guess you&rsquo;ll get away with your
full share, Andy,&rdquo; was the retort.</p>
<p>At last the boys considered themselves safe and
crawled from their beds once more. A dim light
was made, and sitting in a circle, they divided
the good things on hand and devoured them with
a keen relish. The turkey proved to be of the
best, and the pie was &ldquo;prime,&rdquo; as Andy expressed
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if Baxter could only see us now,&rdquo; whispered
Pepper, with a mouth half full of turkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would make him dance with joy, I don&rsquo;t
think,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>The little feast kept up the best part of half
an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here goes the last of the pie!&rdquo; cried Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter, we thank thee for this feast!&rdquo; added
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come again,&rdquo; put in Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just you fellows wait, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; came an
unexpected voice from the doorway, and turning
swiftly, they saw Dan Baxter standing there. He
was shaking his fist at the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; gasped Pepper. For the instant he
could say no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspected it from the start,&rdquo; fairly hissed the
bully of Putnam Hall. &ldquo;Just wait, that&rsquo;s all! If
I don&rsquo;t square up you can shoot me!&rdquo; And away
he went, giving the door the hardest kind of a
bang after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now our cake is dough,&rdquo; came from Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d like to know what he&rsquo;ll be after
doin&rsquo;,&rdquo; came curiously from Emerald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he&rsquo;ll have the nerve to call Captain
Putnam?&rdquo; mused Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Jack, promptly. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t
report this, for if he did he knows we would tell
on him too. He&rsquo;ll try to get square some other
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To bed, all of you!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
forget how he slammed that door. Some of the
teachers may be along before we know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remains of the feast were cleared away and
the room put in order. Then the cadets went to
sleep, and slumbered soundly until the bell awoke
them in the morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>It was not until the boys entered the mess-hall
that they saw Dan Baxter again. The bully of
the school looked like a thundercloud, and so did
Reff Ritter, Coulter, and Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have it in for us, that is dead certain,&rdquo;
whispered Andy to Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll have to keep our eyes peeled for
them,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ditmore, stop your talking!&rdquo; came sternly
from Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered the Imp, meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk altogether too much at meals,&rdquo; went
on the sour-looking teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you say another word I&rsquo;ll send you from
the table,&rdquo; stormed Josiah Crabtree, and after that
Pepper said no more.</p>
<p>That morning everything seemed to go wrong
in the classroom. Many lessons were missed and
several teachers were out of humor. Josiah
Crabtree stormed around, and finally told both
Pepper and Jack that they would have to stay in
after school in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, I do not think I am to blame
in this,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I understood you to say
we were to take up pages 180 and 181 in the history
only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said 180 to 184,&rdquo; snapped the teacher.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He did not,&rdquo; murmured Pepper under his
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are growing very negligent in your
studies,&rdquo; went on the teacher, tartly. &ldquo;I shall
not stand for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then sit down,&rdquo; grumbled Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snow, did you speak?&rdquo; thundered Crabtree.</p>
<p>Andy was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snow, answer me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you may remain in after school also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for nothing,&rdquo; growled Andy, but
this time under his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to fix old Crabby,&rdquo; said Pepper,
during recess. &ldquo;I think it is a shame to keep us
in&mdash;with the last of the skating at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pepper&rsquo;s opportunity to torment the teacher
came sooner than expected. That afternoon
Josiah Crabtree had to leave the classroom for
several minutes. At noon the Imp had secured
some flour in a paper bag. He passed up to the
platform, and on the sly placed the bag of flour
in the teacher&rsquo;s desk, turning it upside down, with
the bottom fastened by a slit in the paper to the
lock part of the desk lid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We will now take up our next study,&rdquo; said
Josiah Crabtree, a little later. He looked around
for a lead pencil, but could find none. Then he
walked to his desk, sat down, and started to raise
the lid.</p>
<p>The lid did not work very easily, and he gave it
a nervous jerk. Up it came, and as it did so, the
flour shot down out of the bag, into the desk and
over the teacher&rsquo;s lap. Some arose in a cloud,
covering Crabtree&rsquo;s face and neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wooh!&rdquo; spluttered the teacher, leaping back.
&ldquo;Wh&mdash;what is this? Who&mdash;er&mdash;who&mdash;wooh!&mdash;played
this trick on me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was covered from head to foot with the
flour, which got into his eyes and nose and caused
him to sneeze loudly. His appearance was so
comical all of the students set up a very loud
roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence! silence! I will have silence!&rdquo; roared
the teacher, wrathfully. Then he had to sneeze
some more, and the classroom burst into another
roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crabtree has turned miller!&rdquo; whispered
Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he make a fine-looking statue?&rdquo; came
from Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys! boys! be quiet!&rdquo; stormed Josiah Crabtree.
&ldquo;This is&mdash;ker-chew! outrageous! I demand
to know who&mdash;ker-chew&mdash;ker-chew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody ker-chew around here?&rdquo; asked Pepper,
calmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who did this?&rdquo; fairly yelled the teacher.
&ldquo;Who did it, I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flour,&rdquo; whispered Jack, and this made
some of the boys snicker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruddy, what did you say?&rdquo; demanded Josiah
Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said the flour did it,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really! you are a monument of wisdom,&rdquo;
said the teacher, sarcastically. &ldquo;You may remain
after school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher shut up the flour-covered desk and
brushed himself off with a whisk-broom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole class may stay in after school,&rdquo; he
thundered, a moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do that, Mr. Crabtree,&rdquo; whined Gus
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then who did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Coulter glanced at Pepper, who
quickly doubled up his fist. &ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All stay in&mdash;for one full hour,&rdquo; snapped
the angry teacher, and then went on with the
studies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to tell on Ditmore,&rdquo; whispered Ritter,
to Dan Baxter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind&mdash;that crowd will catch it tomorrow,&rdquo;
answered the bully of the Hall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was too rich for anything,&rdquo; said Andy to
Pepper, when they were out of school at last.
&ldquo;My, but old Crabby was mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coulter wanted to tell on me, but he didn&rsquo;t
dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He respects your fist, that&rsquo;s why,&rdquo; put in Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those chaps have something up their sleeve,&rdquo;
said Jack, with a grave shake of his head.
&ldquo;Everybody keep on the watch, is my advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll watch &rsquo;em,&rdquo; answered Pepper. But the
watch was not close enough, as later events
proved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">THE BOATHOUSE FIRE</span></h2>
<p>On the following evening Pepper was getting
ready to go to bed when, on passing through the
hallway, a folded sheet of paper dropped upon his
head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he murmured and looked
up to the floor above, but could see nobody. He
unfolded the sheet and read the following:</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;<i>To Pepper Ditmore and Jack Ruddy</i>: Go
down to the old, disused boathouse at once if you
want to hear something to your advantage.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">A Friend.</span>&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;This is certainly queer,&rdquo; said the Imp to himself.
&ldquo;I wonder who wrote it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sought out the young major and showed
him the communication. Jack read it with care.
It was written in a loose and evidently a disguised
hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it is some sort of a trick&mdash;to get us to
the old boathouse, Pep,&rdquo; said Jack, after a moment&rsquo;s
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it best to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we can go. If it is one of Baxter&rsquo;s
tricks I&rsquo;ll show him I am not afraid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we take the others along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This note is for you and me only. Are you
afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come on&mdash;we have just time enough,&rdquo;
said the young major, glancing at a clock on the
wall.</p>
<p>Slipping on their overcoats and donning their
caps, they ran to a side door of the building.
They were soon out into the night without anybody
seeing them depart but the boy upstairs who
had dropped the note. He chuckled to himself
and then ran to a window at the end of the long
hallway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something will be doing pretty soon now,&rdquo; he
said to himself, as he made a signal from the
window.</p>
<p>All unconscious of the trap that had been set
for them, Jack and Pepper hurried towards the
old, disused boathouse. It was a dark night, with
a suggestion of either rain or snow in the
air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go slow,&rdquo; whispered Jack, as they came close
to the building. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to run into any
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They soon found themselves at the side of the
building. All was dark, so far as they could
see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anybody,&rdquo; whispered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go inside&mdash;just to show somebody that
we are not afraid,&rdquo; suggested his chum.</p>
<p>They pushed open the door. A strong smell
of cigarette smoke greeted them. Then Pepper
stepped on an empty bottle and almost fell
flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That smoking and drinking crowd has been
here again,&rdquo; said the fun-loving youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! look!&rdquo; ejaculated Jack, pointing to a
corner of the boathouse.</p>
<p>Pepper gazed in the direction and gave a gasp.
And well he might, for as if by magic there came
a spurt of flame, and some dead leaves and dry
wood caught on the instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! what does that mean?&rdquo; called out Jack.
&ldquo;Take care, or you&rsquo;ll set this place on fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer came back. The spurts of flame
increased, and in a twinkling the old boathouse
was on fire in half a dozen places!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, we must get out of here!&rdquo; exclaimed
Pepper. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>They turned, to find the door shut behind them.
They tried it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is against it!&rdquo; ejaculated the young
major. &ldquo;We are shut in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Push!&rdquo; was the answer, and both pushed with
all of their might. The door gave way some, but
not enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again!&rdquo; said Jack, and now they shoved as
never before. In the meantime the flames were
increasing with marvelous rapidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must get out, or we&rsquo;ll be burnt up!&rdquo; said
Pepper, and a final attack was made on the door,
and it went back, showing that a heavy timber
had been placed against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are out!&rdquo; they heard somebody cry, and
then they saw three forms sneaking around to
the back of the school building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! fire! fire!&rdquo; was the cry from Putnam
Hall, and from the school poured some students
and several teachers, including George Strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the old boathouse,&rdquo; said George Strong.
&ldquo;I wonder how it caught?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! here come Ruddy and Ditmore!&rdquo; exclaimed
Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;They have been down
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire! fire!&rdquo; yelled Pepper and Jack. &ldquo;The
old boathouse is burning up!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>The alarm was soon a general one, and it was
not long before Captain Putnam appeared upon
the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid the old building is doomed,&rdquo; said
the master of Putnam Hall. He was the calmest
man present. &ldquo;The Hall hose will not reach
to this spot. We can try our buckets, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some weeks before the boys had formed a
bucket brigade, as it is termed, and they had the
drill down to perfection. At the word from Captain
Putnam they ran for their buckets and
formed a line from the barn to the burning building.
At the barn there was a big tub of water,
and this was kept filled by some, while others
passed along the buckets. Thus an almost steady
stream of water was poured on the growing fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, let us use snowballs!&rdquo; cried one cadet,
who was not in the bucket line, and in a twinkling
the snowballs began to fly.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">

<p class="center small">IN A TWINKLING THE SNOWBALLS BEGAN TO FLY</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to get the best of that fire yet,&rdquo;
said Dale, passing the buckets to George Strong,
who was throwing the water on the conflagration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks so,&rdquo; answered the teacher.</p>
<p>It soon began to snow. The flakes were thick
and wet, and this put an additional damper on the
fire. Presently the flames died down and ten
minutes later the last spark was extinguished; and
the excitement came practically to an end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>Everybody wanted to know how the fire had
started. It soon became noised around that Jack
and Pepper had been seen coming from the burning
building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you to say to this, Major
Ruddy?&rdquo; asked Captain Putnam, in rather a stern
voice.</p>
<p>Jack knew not what to say. He looked at
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, answer me,&rdquo; went on the master of the
academy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;er&mdash;we went out to see if we could find
some other boys,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got a note,&rdquo; put in Pepper. He placed
his hand in his pocket and drew out the folded
sheet of paper. &ldquo;We&mdash;well, I declare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Ditmore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pepper did not answer, for he was staring at
the sheet. It was almost blank, only a few traces
of letters remaining on it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ditmore, answer me!&rdquo; came from Captain
Putnam, and now his voice was more stern than
ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;er&mdash;look at that!&rdquo; and he held out
the sheet.</p>
<p>The captain glanced at the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see nothing but paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it&mdash;er&mdash;it had something written on
it awhile ago,&rdquo; stammered Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ve got the wrong paper,&rdquo; suggested
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo; The Imp began to search
his pockets. &ldquo;No, this is the right one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was written in evaporating ink,&rdquo; said
the young major. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trick,&rdquo; he murmured to
his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faded out, and so soon,&rdquo; murmured Pepper.
&ldquo;That stumps me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do not you two boys explain?&rdquo; went on
Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe they can explain,&rdquo; put in
Josiah Crabtree, who stood near. &ldquo;They have
been up to mischief. More than likely they set
the boathouse on fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t even have a light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, let the boys explain,&rdquo; said the
captain, stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam, I think I can explain,&rdquo; retorted
the teacher. &ldquo;To-day I made a discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the students have been in the habit
of going down to the old boathouse to smoke and
to drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To smoke and to drink!&rdquo; cried the master of
the Hall, &ldquo;You are sure of this?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you not report to me at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not find it out until this afternoon. I
was on my way to speak to you about it when the
alarm of fire rang out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahem! And you think, Mr. Crabtree&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
The captain paused suggestively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Ruddy and Ditmore are guilty. They
were smoking and they set the building on fire,
perhaps by accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, there isn&rsquo;t a word of truth in
that!&rdquo; cried Jack, his temper rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! don&rsquo;t contradict me!&rdquo; cried Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we shall contradict you,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;We have not been smoking, neither have we
been drinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were down to the old boathouse,&rdquo; put
in Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We admit that,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;We went down
there for a certain purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that purpose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you, exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were looking for some other students,&rdquo;
said Pepper. &ldquo;Some fellows who are enemies of
ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was the building on fire when you got there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see any fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; The master of the Hall mused for a
moment. &ldquo;How did the fire start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sprang up all at once,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;We
got scared and started to run away. Then we
found the door closed, and we had a big job getting
out of the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a fine story to tell,&rdquo; sneered Josiah
Crabtree. &ldquo;Captain Putnam, if I were you, I&rsquo;d
place them in a room by themselves, while we
make an investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Crabtree&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am certain we shall learn a good deal,&rdquo; went
on the assistant teacher. And then he whispered
something into the ear of the master of the Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think best,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam.
&ldquo;Come with me, boys,&rdquo; he added, to Jack and
Pepper, and led the way to the school, and then
to his private office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will listen to what you have to say later,
Major Ruddy,&rdquo; said the master of the Hall.
&ldquo;For the present both of you must remain here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Captain Putnam walked out, locking the
door after him, and leaving Jack and Pepper in
a decidedly unsettled state of mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">UNDER SUSPICION</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of this, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is in the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that. If possible, old Crabtree is
going to get us into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Crabtree alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the work of Dan Baxter and his crowd.
Don&rsquo;t forget the three fellows we saw sneaking
from the old boathouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so! Do you suppose they set the place
on fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do&mdash;either by accident or design.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose they meant to burn us
up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, they knew we could get out. But it
would take time, and they wanted to detain us, so
that we&rsquo;d be found down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we were found, and now we&rsquo;re in a mess
over it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>After that both cadets looked at the sheet of
paper once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The writing has entirely evaporated,&rdquo; said
Pepper. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see a scratch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea who dropped the note?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was a friend who wanted us to
learn what the Baxter crowd was up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. I think the whole thing is
a plot against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys talked the matter over for some time,
but could make no progress towards a solution
of the mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Baxter did it, it was done to get square
because we spoilt their feast,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we squeal on them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be a tale-bearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For fully an hour nobody came near them.
They heard the students retire, and later on heard
a murmur of voices in the hallway. Then Captain
Putnam appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of you will come with me,&rdquo; he said,
coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, captain&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is too late to discuss the situation to-night,&rdquo;
cut in the master of the Hall. &ldquo;We will talk it
over in the morning, and then I will decide what
is to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would not listen to another word, and
meekly they followed him out of the office and
down a side hallway to where there was a small
room.</p>
<p>This room had been designed for stores, but
it was almost empty. The two boys saw that in
it had been placed two cots and a quantity of
blankets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will remain here all night,&rdquo; said Captain
Putnam. &ldquo;There is a pitcher of water for you.&rdquo;
And then he withdrew, leaving them to themselves.
The door was locked and bolted, and
they heard the captain walk rapidly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of that?&rdquo; declared
Pepper, gazing around blankly. &ldquo;Are we prisoners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly looks like it, Pep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for nothing at all! It&rsquo;s an outrage,
Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam appeared to be very angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he wouldn&rsquo;t listen to a word! I
never dreamed it of him, never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one thing is certain&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got to stay
here until morning. Look at the window.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>The blinds were closed, and over them had been
nailed several heavy slats. The room was rather
cold, and they had only a small lamp for illumination.</p>
<p>When Pepper awoke he thought somebody was
whistling in his ear. He listened intently and
soon discovered that the whistling came through
the keyhole of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; he asked, rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Pep?&rdquo; came in Andy&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Jack there, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And now the Imp aroused his chum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it all about anyway? Our crowd is
all upset over it,&rdquo; continued Andy, in a low voice.</p>
<p>Pepper and Jack told as much as they knew,
and their acrobatic friend listened with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to let you out, but the door is locked
and I haven&rsquo;t any key,&rdquo; went on Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, we can stay here just as well,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something was doing in our dormitory too,&rdquo;
went on Andy. &ldquo;We started to go to bed, when
old Crabtree came up and ordered us out. Then
he went in and shut the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he do there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he made some kind of a search. Presently
he called for Captain Putnam, and then
both stayed in the room quarter of an hour.
After that we were told to go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something is certainly wrong,&rdquo; mused Pepper.
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have to await developments,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was too cold for Andy to remain in the hall
long, and soon he went back to his dormitory, and
Pepper and Jack went to sleep as before.</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning Peleg Snuggers
came in, with a big tray containing the boys&rsquo;
breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! are we to remain here?&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; answered the general-utility man
of Putnam Hall. &ldquo;I was ordered to bring your
breakfast, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who ordered it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Captain Putnam know of it?&rdquo; asked
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam went away at six o&rsquo;clock this
morning. Had some special business in Rochester,
I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went away!&rdquo; echoed Jack. &ldquo;Then old
Crabby&mdash;I mean Mr. Crabtree, is in charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Pep, that won&rsquo;t be to our advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. He hates us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he hates most o&rsquo; you young gents,&rdquo;
whispered Peleg Snuggers, who had no great love
for the teacher in question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You tell Mr. Crabtree that we want to see
him,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. You tell him we insist upon seeing
him,&rdquo; put in Pepper.</p>
<p>Peleg Snuggers placed the breakfast on a stand
and withdrew, locking the door as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a slim meal,&rdquo; observed the young
major, looking at what had been brought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is going to starve us as well as keep us
prisoners,&rdquo; was the Imp&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>As both boys were hungry it did not take them
long to stow away everything in sight. Then
both began to walk around the cold cell, in order
to keep warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is outrageous!&rdquo; cried Pepper, at last.
&ldquo;I am not going to stand it another minute!&rdquo;
And going to the door he began to hammer upon
it loudly. Jack, also out of sorts, did the
same.</p>
<p>The racket was soon heard in the classrooms,
and presently Josiah Crabtree came rushing to
the place, a heavy switch in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi! stop that noise!&rdquo; thundered the assistant
teacher. &ldquo;Stop it, I say!&rdquo; And he threw
open the door and confronted the pair, with
snapping eyes and with a face red from indignation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>As soon as the door was opened Jack and Pepper
stopped kicking and pounding. Both faced
the instructor fearlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by such a noise?&rdquo; demanded
Josiah Crabtree, after an ominous pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wanted to attract attention,&rdquo; answered
Pepper, calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to keep quiet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, will you tell us why we are
prisoners here?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are prisoners because you have disobeyed
the rules of this institution,&rdquo; snapped the instructor,
and there was a certain gleam of triumph in
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How have we disobeyed the rules?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; came from Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t contradict, Ditmore! Captain Putnam
and myself have found you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you please explain?&rdquo; asked Jack, as
calmly as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in the first place, you are responsible for
the fire at the boathouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; came from both boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have made a rigid investigation,&rdquo; returned
Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;It is useless to deny it,&rdquo; he
continued. &ldquo;But that is not the worst of it, in the
eyes of myself and Captain Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is the worst?&rdquo; asked Jack, curiously,
and wondering what was coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of you went down to the old boathouse
to smoke and drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deny that flatly,&rdquo; said the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; added Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denials will do you no good. We have the
evidence,&rdquo; returned Josiah Crabtree, and once
again his rather fishy eyes showed a gleam of
triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What evidence have you?&rdquo; demanded Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After we locked you up here, I suggested to
the captain that we search your dormitory. This
was done, and we have uncovered your secrets.
The captain is amazed, and so am I. We did not
dream that any cadet at this school would be
guilty of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty of what?&rdquo; asked Jack and Pepper, in
a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty of such bad habits. We went into your
lockers and your trunks, and we discovered two
bottles of liquor, eight packages of cigarettes, and
three packs of playing-cards, all belonging to you
two students. You know our rules. You have
broken them, and you must either be punished
or else be dismissed from this school!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">FROM CELLAR TO ATTIC</span></h2>
<p>For the moment after Josiah Crabtree made
this declaration Jack and Pepper were so amazed
that they could not speak. They stared at the
teacher as if they had not heard aright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say you found such things
in our trunks and lockers?&rdquo; asked the young
major, at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do, Ruddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a&mdash;a trick!&rdquo; burst out Pepper. &ldquo;A mean,
rascally trick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there was no trick about it,&rdquo; answered
Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mr. Crabtree, there must be some mistake,&rdquo;
faltered Jack. &ldquo;I do not drink or smoke or
play cards, and neither does Pepper. Surely you
have made a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No mistake about it, I tell you. I found the
things as plain as day, and Captain Putnam saw
them too. You had the things hidden pretty well,
but our search was thorough. After the fire I
suspected you at once, for I saw the evidence of
smoking and drinking around the burnt building.
You may as well confess. It will do no good to
put on an innocent front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, will you listen to me?&rdquo; asked
Pepper, half desperately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish to confess, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to confess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I do not care to listen. You are a pair
of bad boys, and in the absence of Captain Putnam
I am bound to make an example of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Captain Putnam was here he would listen
to us,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am capable of taking charge of this affair,&rdquo;
answered the teacher, coldly. A little brief authority
always made him strong-headed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I repeat, I am guilty of no wrongdoing,&rdquo; said
Jack, simply. &ldquo;There is some mistake somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am innocent, too,&rdquo; added Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After this, I want you two boys to behave
yourselves,&rdquo; resumed Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;If you
don&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to stay here,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beastly place and we&rsquo;ll catch our death of
cold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You shall stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I protest!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruddy, it will do no good, I tell you. And
let me tell you something more. Your conduct
is unworthy of an officer. After this, you shall
be a private, nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to take my majorship away
from me!&rdquo; gasped Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s heart sank within him. This was
the unkindest cut of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dirt mean!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;Jack, for
two pins I&rsquo;d write home about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and leave Putnam Hall,&rdquo; added the deposed
major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You two boys will behave yourselves!&rdquo; roared
Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;If you make any more trouble
I&rsquo;ll show you a thing or two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this the teacher went out, banging and
locking the door behind him.</p>
<p>Jack and Pepper felt hurt and angry. They
had done nothing wrong, and did not consider
that they were being treated fairly.</p>
<p>The forenoon dragged by slowly and both boys
were chilled. Growing desperate, Pepper began
to hammer on the door again and his chum followed
suit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>For fully quarter of an hour nobody paid attention
to the noise, and they were on the point
of stopping the racket when Josiah Crabtree again
appeared, followed by Peleg Snuggers and another
man, who did occasional jobs around Putnam
Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold out your hands,&rdquo; said the teacher,
grimly; and almost before they knew it, Jack and
Pepper were handcuffed. Then the teacher
slipped the key of the handcuffs into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, is a high-handed proceeding,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you objected to the cold,&rdquo; said the
teacher, ignoring the remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did&mdash;I am half frozen,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come, and I&rsquo;ll provide you with a
warmer place,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>It would have been useless to resist in the presence
of the three men, and so the boys marched
out of the storeroom and along the hallway.
Soon they came to a cellar door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to put us down in the cellar?&rdquo;
cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;March, and do not ask any more questions,&rdquo;
said Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>The boys tried to argue, but the assistant
teacher would not listen. Down into the cellar
went the party and walked along until they came
to a square stone room that was built close to one
of the big heaters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t freeze here,&rdquo; said the teacher, and
shoved them inside. &ldquo;Now, if you make any
more noise, you shall not have a mouthful of
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the door was closed and locked on the
two unfortunates. They heard the others hurry
away, and faced each other in the gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the worst yet,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
regular dungeon cell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an outrage and I shall not stand for it,&rdquo;
was his chum&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Phew! how hot it is!
That furnace is a regular bake-oven!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First he freezes us and then he bakes us,&rdquo;
muttered Pepper. &ldquo;Oh, but he is a hard-hearted
wretch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is something to make you feel better,&rdquo;
said Jack, when he felt certain nobody was watching
them. &ldquo;Hold out your hands, Pep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Imp did so and Jack commenced to feel of
the lock of the handcuffs. Soon Pepper was at
liberty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However did you do it, Jack?&rdquo; he questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I watched my chance and took the key from
old Crabby&rsquo;s pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now unfasten my bracelets, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>With their hands at liberty, the boys felt a
trifle better. But the semi-darkness and the heat
did not suit them at all. Besides this, the hot
stone room was full of a dry dust that set them
to coughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to put old Crabtree in this place,&rdquo;
muttered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we can&rsquo;t get out, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What good will it do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot of good. We can remain out of Crabtree&rsquo;s
reach until Captain Putnam gets back.
Then we can demand a hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you are going to get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got a match?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nary a one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us explore in the dark then. Start at the
door. I&rsquo;ll go to the right and you can go to the
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was done, and they went over the stone
walls with care. Nothing in the way of an opening
presented itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let us try the flooring above,&rdquo; said
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we reach it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a bench in the room, and they turned
this up on one end. Then Pepper boosted his
chum to the top. Jack felt around with care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a crack in the floor,&rdquo; said he, presently.
&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo; queried the Imp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a streak of light and then it suddenly
disappeared. I think&mdash;&mdash; There it is again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack turned his eye upward, and now Pepper
saw the light also. It lasted about half a minute
and then disappeared, and the boys heard the
slamming of a door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what it is now,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;The
flooring above is that of some storeroom or closet.
Somebody opened the door, letting in some light.
Then the door was closed again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can get up into the room or closet.
Are any of the boards loose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try them and find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack began to press upward and soon found a
board that was loose at one end. He worked at
it and soon had an opening large enough to admit
the passage of his body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your hand,&rdquo; he whispered to Pepper.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make any noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon the Imp was standing beside his chum on
the upturned end of the bench. Then both
crawled through the opening above. As Pepper
followed Jack the bench fell over with a crash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, put the board down! Somebody may
come!&rdquo; ejaculated Jack, and they replaced the
flooring of the closet in which they now found
themselves. It was partly filled with clothing for
outdoor wear, and also held rubbers, rubber boots,
and umbrellas.</p>
<p>The cadets waited, and as nobody came they
gradually breathed more freely. They tried the
door to the closet, to find it unlocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the next move?&rdquo; asked Pepper,
after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get out of this, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo;
answered Jack.</p>
<p>They tiptoed their way out of the closet and
found themselves in the main hallway of the academy.
Then they ran up the front stairs and into
their dormitory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew when Captain Putnam will get
back,&rdquo; observed Jack, after they had looked
around, to find the sleeping quarters empty.</p>
<p>Below they could hear the students returning
to their classrooms, having had their midday
meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost our dinners, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo; said
Pepper, with a sigh. &ldquo;If only we had some of
Dan Baxter&rsquo;s stuff here now, it wouldn&rsquo;t go half
bad, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I think, Pep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Dan Baxter put up a job on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that liquor, cigarettes, and cards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Would he be mean enough to do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. Remember, he was terribly angry
over that feast affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know that. If he put up a job on us
I&rsquo;d like to prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be a hard thing to do. No doubt
he covered up his tracks well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys remained in the dormitory for some
time and then stole to the rear of the Hall and
down a back stairs. This brought them close
to the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we could only get into the pantry,&rdquo; whispered
Pepper. &ldquo;I am going to try it!&rdquo; he added,
with sudden determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am with you,&rdquo; answered his chum.</p>
<p>Watching their chance, they crossed the kitchen
and entered the pantry, on the shelves of which
rested a variety of good things. There was a
basket handy, and into it they put such things as
they desired. Some maids came into the kitchen,
but then went back to the mess-hall, in one corner
of which they were now having their own
dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now is our chance!&rdquo; cried Jack, softly, and
once more they crossed the kitchen and made for
the stairs. In a few minutes they were on the
upper floor, and there they almost ran straight
into Dale Blackmore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; cried Dale, staring as if he saw two
ghosts. &ldquo;I thought you were prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were, but we escaped,&rdquo; explained Jack.
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t tell on us, will you, Dale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me tell on you?&rdquo; said the other cadet, reproachfully.
&ldquo;Not by a jugful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know when Captain Putnam is coming
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until to-morrow morning, so I heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pepper and Jack looked at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do next?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us stay in hiding until the captain gets
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was decided, and Dale told them of a
vacant room on the top floor where they might
make themselves comfortable in the meantime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got a bed in it and all,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You
can lock yourselves in and I&rsquo;ll keep you posted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They talked the matter over a few minutes and
then went to the room. It contained no heater,
but the main chimney of the Hall was at one end,
making it fairly comfortable. From a window
they could get a view of the road leading to
Cedarville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make yourselves at home,&rdquo; said Dale, on departing.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to keep you posted.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">JOSIAH CRABTREE&rsquo;S TROUBLES</span></h2>
<p>There was a key in the lock of the door, and
the two cadets locked themselves in. Then they
proceeded to unpack the basket of good things,
and sitting on the edge of the bed, began to
satisfy their hunger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This certainly beats the cellar,&rdquo; said Jack,
munching some cold roast beef and a biscuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we can keep our eyes on the road
below,&rdquo; answered his chum. &ldquo;If the captain
comes I believe in reporting to him at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they had nothing else to do, they took their
time eating, and then placed what was left to one
side, for supper and a possible breakfast. Then
Pepper strolled to the window and gazed down
on the campus below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are Crabtree and Snuggers looking all
around the place! I&rsquo;ll wager a bun to a bakery
that they think we have run away from the Hall!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Jack looked out also, and both boys saw the
teacher and the general-utility man walk all
around the campus and then disappear in the direction
of the gymnasium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they have a good time looking for us,&rdquo;
observed Pepper, with a broad grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;ll come up here next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they do we&rsquo;ll have to lay low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearly an hour passed, and then they heard
footsteps in the hall outside. Instantly both became
quiet as mice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to be around here,&rdquo; they
heard Peleg Snuggers remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us look in all the rooms,&rdquo; answered Josiah
Crabtree.</p>
<p>The boys almost held their breath as they heard
the door tried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is locked up,&rdquo; said Snuggers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; answered the assistant teacher,
and they heard his hand upon the knob. &ldquo;Have
you a key, Snuggers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a brief pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, are you in there?&rdquo; called out Josiah
Crabtree. &ldquo;If you are, answer me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A deathlike silence followed. Jack and Pepper
scarcely dared to breathe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They couldn&rsquo;t git up here nohow, Mr. Crabtree,&rdquo;
said the general-utility man. &ldquo;Somebody
would be sure to see &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. Boys that will
crawl through the flooring of a closet will do
almost anything,&rdquo; grumbled the teacher. &ldquo;Who
has the key to this room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely Mrs. Green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Green was the matron of the Hall, she
having charge of all the female help and also doing
a great deal for the small boys in the institution.
At the mention of her name the hearts of
the cadets sank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree!&rdquo; called a voice, from the floor
below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; returned the assistant teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wanted in the office, sir&mdash;a gentleman
to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gave the name of Simon&mdash;Andrew Simon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really! My old friend Simon!&rdquo; murmured
the teacher. &ldquo;Snuggers, I will go below at once.
We can continue this search at another time.&rdquo;
And down the stairs went Josiah Crabtree and the
general-utility man after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew! but that was a narrow escape,&rdquo; murmured
Jack. &ldquo;If they had gotten in here our cake
would have been dough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>After that the boys found the time hanging
heavily on their hands. They talked the situation
over in a low tone, but could reach no satisfactory
conclusion.</p>
<p>Presently it grew darker and began to rain,
the storm keeping up far into the night. This
made a noise on the roof, so they could talk with
but little danger of being heard.</p>
<p>At supper-time they partook of some more of
the eatables in the basket and then prepared to
make themselves comfortable for the night. They
were resting on the bed when they heard a low
whistle at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; came in Andy&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>They unlocked the door, and there stood Andy
and Stuffer, each with some supper done up in a
napkin. Andy also had a candle and some
matches. Dale had told them where to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had a time getting this here,&rdquo; said Stuffer,
after the candle had been lit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Crabtree is nearly crazy, thinking you
have run away from the Hall,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;He
and Snuggers have been hunting all over for you.
They even sent word to Cedarville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let Crabby worry&mdash;he deserves it,&rdquo;
grumbled Pepper. &ldquo;Say, it&rsquo;s mighty good of you
to bring this,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here are a couple of new magazines, too,&rdquo; said
Stuffer, handing them over. &ldquo;I got them from
the library. They&rsquo;ll help you to pass away the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy and Stuffer did not dare to remain upstairs
long, and soon left, and then the door was
locked as before and Jack hung his handkerchief
over the keyhole. The curtain to the window
was drawn down tightly, so that the candlelight
might not be seen by anybody outside.</p>
<p>Several hours went by and the academy became
quiet. Both boys had read for awhile and
also taken several naps. Then Pepper started up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack, I&rsquo;ve an idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now, Pep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go downstairs after old Crabby is to
bed and play some trick on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be all right&mdash;if we didn&rsquo;t get
caught. But if he catches us it will go so much
harder with us when it comes to a settlement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said the Imp, recklessly. &ldquo;We
may as well be hung for sheep as lambs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They talked the matter over, and at last concluded
to go below. The candle was extinguished
and the door opened with care. They crawled
cautiously to the top of the stairs and looked
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody is in bed by this time,&rdquo; whispered
Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>They waited a little, to make certain. Then
they crept down and made their way to the door
of the apartment which the assistant teacher
occupied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s asleep and snoring,&rdquo; said Jack, and told
the truth.</p>
<p>They tried the door and found it unlocked.
With extreme care they entered the room. A
dim light was burning in a corner of the apartment,
casting shadows in all directions. Covered
up on the bed lay Josiah Crabtree, flat on his back
and with a nightcap on his head.</p>
<p>Their first move was to transfer the key of the
door from the inside to the outside. This done,
Pepper got a washbowl of cold water and placed
it on the floor beside the bed. Then they took
several of the chairs and placed them on the floor
sideways, and put down several piles of books
near by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now open the window wide,&rdquo; whispered
Pepper. &ldquo;But be careful or he may wake
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The window was opened top and bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And the light was put out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then together&mdash;quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>The boys stood at the foot of the bed. Each
took a firm hold of the numerous coverings and
gave them a sharp jerk. Off they came, and in
a twinkling the lads made for the door, taking the
blankets and spread with them. They locked the
door from the outside and scooted for the next
floor, throwing the things they carried in a corner
out of sight.</p>
<p>Josiah Crabtree awoke with a start and uttered
a low cry of alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi&mdash;er&mdash;what does this mean?&rdquo; he cried, and
sat bolt upright. &ldquo;Where are the covers? Help!
Thieves! Robbers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaped out of bed and down into the cold
water went his left foot. He gave a yell of fright
and the next instant stumbled over one of the
chairs and went headlong among the piles of
books. As he was only half awake he was more
alarmed than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Something is wrong here! Thieves!
Robbers!&rdquo; he bawled. &ldquo;What does this mean!
Oh! oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to get up, and fell over a second chair.
Then he bumped into a stand and brought down
some more books and some photographs. He
yelled louder than ever, and finally reaching the
door, tried to open it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door! Who locked me in? Wake
up, somebody! They must be robbing the house!
Thieves! Robbers! Help!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>His cries rang out through the Hall, and, soon
George Strong and many others, including cadets,
were awakened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, what is the matter?&rdquo; asked
George Strong, coming to the door, clad in a
dressing-gown and carrying a pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me out! There is a&mdash;er&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know
what is going on! Let me out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no key here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My key is also gone. Somebody has locked
me in. They&mdash;er&mdash;a&mdash;oh!&rdquo; And in moving
around Josiah Crabtree stumbled again and sat
down on the sharp edge of a chair. &ldquo;This is&mdash;er&mdash;outrageous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time George Strong had brought out a
bunch of keys. One fitted the lock, and the door
was speedily opened. There stood the confused
teacher, trembling in every limb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; he panted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;er&mdash;the robbers who visited my room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen no robbers, Mr. Crabtree. What
did they steal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took my bedclothes, for one thing,&rdquo; growled
the assistant teacher. He was recovering somewhat
from his fright. &ldquo;Wait till I make a
light.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>He managed to find a match, but not before he
had hit his toe on a pile of books and bumped
into one of the chairs again. Then the light was
lit and Josiah Crabtree put on his bath-robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look there, and there, and there!&rdquo; he snarled,
pointing to the coverless bed, the washbowl on
the floor, and the overturned chairs and other
disarranged things. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t that look like
burglars,&mdash;or&mdash;something, Mr. Strong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid some of the students have been
playing a trick on you,&rdquo; said the second assistant
teacher, with a faint smile showing on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trick?&rdquo; gasped Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the robber!&rdquo; cried Andy, coming up
and realizing at once what had occurred. &ldquo;Let
me catch him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, catch him by all means,&rdquo; put in
Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he tried to murder poor Mr. Crabtree,&rdquo;
put in Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Mr. Crabtree, did he hurt yez very
much?&rdquo; asked Emerald, with mock sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if there really was a burglar?&rdquo; said
Dan Baxter, coming to the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope not!&rdquo; cried Mumps, and the toady
began to shiver from fright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is, Mumps,&rdquo; said Andy, coming
close. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s aiming a pistol at you!&rdquo; and the
acrobatic youth pointed down the semi-dark hallway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t shoot!&rdquo; screamed Mumps. &ldquo;Please
don&rsquo;t shoot me!&rdquo; And he caught hold of Dan
Baxter for protection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go,&rdquo; said the bully. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only fooling
you. I don&rsquo;t think there is any burglar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! I wish we were sure,&rdquo; whined
Mumps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">FACING THE MUSIC</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;This is outrageous!&rdquo; stormed Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is certainly too bad,&rdquo; commented George
Strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If some of the students played this trick on
me they should be&mdash;be hung for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, not quite as bad as that, Mr. Crabtree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as bad&mdash;it&rsquo;s worse!&rdquo; stormed the unreasonable
teacher. &ldquo;I am not going to permit it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this the second assistant teacher said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, who did this?&rdquo; demanded Josiah Crabtree,
eyeing the assembled crowd with great
severity. &ldquo;Answer me at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you say it was a burglar?&rdquo; asked Andy,
meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he called out thieves,&rdquo; came from
Stuffer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;I may have done that, but I am now
satisfied somebody has been playing tricks,&rdquo; said
Josiah Crabtree. &ldquo;I intend to discover the offender
and punish him severely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, I didn&rsquo;t do it, I assure you,&rdquo;
piped in Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mumpsy dear wouldn&rsquo;t do such a wicked
thing,&rdquo; came from a student in the rear, and this
caused a snicker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I demand to know what has been done with
the bedclothing,&rdquo; resumed the irate teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, who has Mr. Crabtree&rsquo;s bedclothes?&rdquo;
sang out Andy. &ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t all speak at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; cried Hogan, and threw the
bundle at Andy&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were they?&rdquo; cried Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here, in the corner,&rdquo; answered the Irish
cadet. &ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s a queer happening entirely, so
it is,&rdquo; he added, soberly, but with a twinkle in his
merry eyes.</p>
<p>Try his best Josiah Crabtree could not learn
who had been guilty of disturbing him, and at last
ordered the cadets to retire. Then he straightened
out his room and went to bed again, this
time making certain to lock the door and placing
a chair against it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>From the upper landing Jack and Pepper saw
and heard something of what went on and
laughed heartily. Then they too retired, and
slept soundly until the morning bell awoke
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we haven&rsquo;t got to hurry, that&rsquo;s one comfort,&rdquo;
observed the Imp, as he proceeded to dress
leisurely. &ldquo;Jack, our time&rsquo;s our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we must be ready to go to Captain
Putnam as soon as he arrives,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;We want him to understand that we are willing
to submit to what he does, but not to Crabtree&rsquo;s
harshness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They heard the cadets march to the mess-hall
for breakfast. A little later a carriage came
along the road towards the Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the captain now!&rdquo; cried Jack, who
was on the watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go down and present ourselves as soon
as possible&mdash;before Crabtree can tell his story,&rdquo;
said Pepper.</p>
<p>Disposing of the basket and what was left of
the eating, they stole downstairs and then to the
front of the Hall. They were just in time to see
Captain Putnam walk towards his office. Beside
him was Josiah Crabtree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ran away!&rdquo; the master of the academy was
saying. &ldquo;You are sure of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, sir,&rdquo; answered the assistant teacher.
&ldquo;We hunted everywhere for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made them do it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They got scared, I imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not mistreat them in any way, Mr.
Crabtree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no! On the contrary, I think I used
them too good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, listen to that!&rdquo; whispered Pepper.
&ldquo;What an old fraud he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I will listen to the story in detail after
the school has been opened,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam,
after a pause, and then he entered his office,
while Josiah Crabtree passed on to one of the
classrooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now come on, Pep,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Let us put
on a bold front and face the music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They marched down the stairs and knocked on
the door of the office. There was a rustling of
papers, and then the voice of Captain Putnam
bade them enter.</p>
<p>The master of the Hall was looking over a mass
of legal documents. He stared at the boys in
considerable astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I understood you two students had run
away!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, we did not run away, Captain Putnam,&rdquo;
answered Jack. &ldquo;We have not been outside
of this building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then where have you been?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In one of the vacant rooms at the top, sir,&rdquo;
answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you hide away there?&rdquo; And the
voice of the master of the Hall grew stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got away and hid because we did not like
the way Mr. Crabtree treated us,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;At
first we were put in a room where we were nearly
frozen, and then he put us down in the cellar,
close to the big furnace, and nearly baked us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t come here to be put in the cellar,&rdquo;
put in Pepper. &ldquo;Especially when we have done
no wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you were put in the cellar? I did not
know that,&rdquo; and now the captain&rsquo;s face softened
a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam, I think we are not being
treated fairly,&rdquo; said Jack, earnestly. &ldquo;We have
done no wrong, and is it right to condemn us
without a hearing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect to listen to your story, Ruddy, and I
will also listen to what Ditmore has to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you listen now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be at leisure in an hour. You may
come to this office then. Have you had breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a little,&rdquo; and Pepper smiled faintly
as he answered the question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then go to the mess-room and get the meal.
If you see Mr. Crabtree tell him that I said you
were to report to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; answered both cadets, and left a
moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll come out all right,&rdquo; said Jack, on
the way to the dining-room. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll
stand for Crabtree&rsquo;s putting us down in the cellar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s our strong point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inside of an hour after the boys left the office
Josiah Crabtree came in and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I will listen to what you have to say
about Ruddy and Ditmore,&rdquo; said the master of
the Hall.</p>
<p>Josiah Crabtree told his tale, with many exaggerations.
According to what he said, Jack and
Pepper acted in a most vicious manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are natural-born young rascals,&rdquo; said
the assistant teacher. &ldquo;If we can locate them, we
must make examples of them, Captain Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they are not so bad as you think, Mr.
Crabtree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are every bit as bad&mdash;maybe worse.
They ran away because they were afraid to face
the consequences of their misdoings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they did not run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;er&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did not run away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>At this announcement the jaw of the assistant
instructor dropped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they didn&rsquo;t run away where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment came another knock on the
office door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the captain, and Jack entered,
followed by Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; murmured Josiah Crabtree.
&ldquo;Where did you come from, you young villains!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gently, Mr. Crabtree,&rdquo; interposed the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, I am not a villain and I don&rsquo;t
want you or anybody else to call me one,&rdquo; said
Jack, hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! don&rsquo;t talk to me!&rdquo; spluttered the assistant
teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree, I will examine the two young
gentlemen in private,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam, decisively.
&ldquo;I will thank you to take charge of the
classes for the present. I will send word when I
wish to see you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a strong hint that he was not wanted,
and with rather bad grace the assistant teacher
retired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Ruddy, tell me your story,&rdquo; went on
Captain Putnam. &ldquo;Tell me the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will, sir,&rdquo; answered Jack; and in a plain,
straightforward manner told how Pepper had
come to him with the strange note, and how they
had hurried down to the old boathouse. Then
he related how they had seen the fire start up and
found themselves locked in, and how they had
gotten out and given the alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw those cigarette butts there once before,
and also an empty liquor bottle,&rdquo; he added.
&ldquo;But I do not remember that we saw any playing-cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you anything to add to this story?&rdquo;
asked the captain of Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, excepting to say that Jack has told
the exact truth, Captain Putnam. We had nothing
to do with the fire and nothing to do with the
cigarettes or drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the cigarettes, cards, and liquor
that were found in your belongings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they were found there, they were put there
by somebody who wanted to do us harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely the same party who got Pepper
to go to the boathouse with me,&rdquo; added Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea who that party can be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, but I should not like to speak of that,&rdquo;
answered Jack, firmly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">A CHALLENGE ACCEPTED</span></h2>
<p>Captain Putnam looked at both cadets
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of you suspect somebody, is that it?&rdquo; he
said, slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not certain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not certain, and therefore it would not
be right for us to mention any names,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me the truth of your trouble with Mr.
Crabtree,&rdquo; pursued the captain, after a thoughtful
pause.</p>
<p>Thereupon, the two boys told how they had
been taken from the cold storeroom and placed in
the cellar, and how they had escaped through the
clothing closet above. At the recital the captain
had to turn away his face, to conceal a smile that
hovered around his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t think it was fair at all,&rdquo; went on
Jack. &ldquo;So when we got out we determined to
hide until you got back and then come to you.
And that is just what we have done.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>The captain was silent and nodded slowly to
himself several times. Then he took a deep
breath and rubbed his chin reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys!&rdquo; he exclaimed, decisively. &ldquo;I am going
to take you at your word. You can return to
your studies and forget what has passed. Does
that suit you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It suits me!&rdquo; exclaimed Jack, and his heart
gave a bound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me, too,&rdquo; added Pepper. &ldquo;I am much
obliged, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is some mystery here, and some day
perhaps we shall get at the bottom of it. I expect
you to help me all you can to clear it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam, am I to&mdash;re&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
Jack could not go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what, Ruddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Crabtree said I was to&mdash;er&mdash;to give up
being major of the battalion&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will take your place as formerly, Major
Ruddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; And now the youthful
major&rsquo;s face fairly beamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will attend to this matter so far as it concerns
Mr. Crabtree,&rdquo; went on the master of the
Hall. &ldquo;You may go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; cried both cadets, and ran off
with hearts as light as air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, glad to see you back!&rdquo; whispered
Andy, as they took their seats. &ldquo;How did you
get out of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you after school,&rdquo; said Jack, and Pepper
said the same.</p>
<p>Josiah Crabtree tried to question them, but
they referred the assistant teacher to Captain
Putnam. Later in the day the master of the Hall
and Crabtree had a long session together, but
what was said none of the students ever learned.
But after that Josiah Crabtree was decidedly
meek for a long while to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he got a calling-down,&rdquo; said Pepper,
to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t you think he deserved it?&rdquo; returned
the young major.</p>
<p>After this affair Dan Baxter and his cronies
were more bitter than ever against Pepper, Jack,
and the others. Of course the plot to injure the
boys had been gotten up by the bully, to pay them
back for spoiling the proposed feast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crabtree must have made a mess of it,&rdquo;
growled Dan Baxter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; answered Reff Ritter. &ldquo;Well,
we&rsquo;ll have to try something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; answered the bully. &ldquo;And
next time we&rsquo;ll make a sure thing of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>Several weeks passed along rather quietly.
During that time the weather changed rapidly.
The rain had washed away the snow and most of
the ice, and now the grass began to grow green
and the trees pushed forth their leaves and the
bushes their buds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad spring and summer are coming,&rdquo;
cried Andy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;Hurrah for
baseball!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And rowing,&rdquo; put in Dale.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the boys loved to row, and at the
earliest opportunity the boats at the new boathouse
were repaired and gotten out. At first the
lads were a bit stiff at the oars, but soon limbered
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is something like,&rdquo; said Andy, while he
and some of the others were out in two of the
boats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us have a little race,&rdquo; suggested Jack, and
off the two boats started, up the lake a distance of
half a mile. They kept side by side, and presently
the race was declared a tie, and then the
rowers stopped to rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got news,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;Some of the students
from Pornell Academy want to row us a
race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they get enough last summer?&rdquo; asked
Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is something of a new crowd,&rdquo; went on
Dale. &ldquo;Do you remember Roy Bock, and
Grimes, and Gussie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we?&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;The chaps who
stopped us in the woods one night and wanted us
to promise that we would not visit the Fords
again. I rather guess we do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a bully that Roy Bock was!&rdquo; put in
Jack. &ldquo;Almost as bad as Baxter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Stuffer. &ldquo;And that chap
Grimes is about his equal. The Pornell students
must be sick of that crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the Pornell students are nice
enough,&rdquo; was Dale&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they are!&rdquo; said Emerald. &ldquo;So they are!
But not Bock&mdash;no, not Bock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what about this race, Dale?&rdquo; questioned
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roy Bock, Grimes, Gussie, and four others of
their crowd want to race a crew of seven, composed
of you, Pepper, Andy, Emerald, Stuffer,
Henry Lee, and myself, and they want to race us
for two miles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do they want to race?&rdquo; asked Pepper,
with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next Saturday afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph; that&rsquo;s rather short notice,&rdquo; was
Andy&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;For all we know they may
have been practicing on the rowing-machine in
their gym.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better put it off until the following Saturday,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Bock says he can&rsquo;t put it off, because they
have got to row elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they want to put up any prize?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a silver cup worth fourteen dollars, each
fellow to chip in a dollar for the trophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that is fair enough,&rdquo; said Hogan. &ldquo;But
if they have been after practicin&rsquo; on their rowin&rsquo;
machine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, let us row them anyway!&rdquo; cried
Pepper. &ldquo;If we refuse they&rsquo;ll think we are
afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll lose,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;That
is, not if we practice hard between now and racing
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do that,&rdquo; said Stuffer, with determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put you on a diet, Stuffer,&rdquo; said Pepper,
with a wink at the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;anything to win,&rdquo; said the boy who
loved good eating. &ldquo;I am glad it is only four
days off instead of three weeks!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>That night a letter was sent accepting the challenge
from the Pornell Academy students, and
on the following day the Putnam Hall cadets
started to practice in earnest. Dale was made
the coxswain, and he coached those under him to
the best of his ability.</p>
<p>It soon became noised about that our friends
were going to row a race against Roy Bock and
his crowd, and at once nearly all of the cadets of
the Hall became interested. As a consequence
some other races were arranged, one between
Baxter, Ritter, Coulter, and Paxton on one side
and four boys from the rival school. The bully
and his friends went around everywhere declaring
that they would surely win.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dale Blackmore and his crowd will lose,
mark my words,&rdquo; said Dan Baxter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; answered Henry Lee, who
chanced to hear the remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you will, I&rsquo;ll bet on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, but I don&rsquo;t bet,&rdquo; said Henry,
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you are afraid,&rdquo; sneered the
bully, and walked off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">THE BOAT RACES</span></h2>
<p>The day for the boat races dawned clear and
bright. There was no breeze and the surface of
Cayuga Lake was almost as smooth as a mill
pond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an ideal day for the contests!&rdquo; cried
Jack, as he and Andy walked down to the boathouse.
&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it doesn&rsquo;t blow up a storm by afternoon,&rdquo;
answered the acrobatic cadet.</p>
<p>The boys went rowing for an hour in the morning,
and Dale coached them as before. George
Strong came down to watch them and gave them
a few &ldquo;points,&rdquo; for he had rowed in the crew of
his college years before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not had quite enough practice,&rdquo; said
the teacher. &ldquo;But you do fairly well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the time came for the races quite a
crowd assembled along the lake shore, and many
were out in rowboats and sailboats and also in
gasoline launches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Mr. Ford is out?&rdquo; said Jack. He
referred to a wealthy gentleman of that district
who owned a beautiful yacht. The season before
Jack, Pepper, and Andy had saved Mr. Ford&rsquo;s
two daughters, Laura and Flossie, from being
drowned, and the gentleman had been their warm
friend ever since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; said Stuffer. &ldquo;Their mansion
at the Point has been closed up for the winter,
and they are not yet back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not long before Roy Bock and his crew
appeared, in a brand-new rowboat which was certainly
a beauty. It was painted black, with a
gold stripe, and cut the water like a thing of
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a better boat than ours,&rdquo; whispered.
Stuffer. &ldquo;No wonder they want to race us. I
guess they want to show off their new boat as
much as anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pornell students had brought with them
a large number of &ldquo;rooters,&rdquo; and these cheered
to the echo when their friends appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Pornell Academy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in and win! You can do it easily!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Putnam Hall!&rdquo; cried the others,
and this cheer also went the length of the course.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>A race between four small boys was the first on
the programme of events, and this was won by
Pornell by three lengths. When the result was
announced the Pornellites cheered lustily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did we tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now go in and win the next race!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next contest was that between some students
of Pornell and Dan Baxter and his cronies.
Both crews got away in good shape, and soon
the bully&rsquo;s crew took the lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter&rsquo;s crew is going to win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, the race isn&rsquo;t finished yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half the race had been rowed, and still the
Baxter crew kept the lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if they might win after all,&rdquo; said
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope they do&mdash;for the honor of Putnam
Hall,&rdquo; put in Jack, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&mdash;Putnam Hall against all
comers!&rdquo; cried Andy.</p>
<p>The race was almost done and Baxter&rsquo;s crew
still had a lead of two lengths. They were rowing
with all their might, but their strength was
almost gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull, fellows!&rdquo; cried the leader of the opponents.
And pull they did until the two boats
were bow to bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the Pornell crew is ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they go over the line!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pornell wins by a full length!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last cry was correct, and once again the
Pornell followers yelled and cheered at the top
of their lungs. Dan Baxter&rsquo;s crew was much
crestfallen and rowed to the Putnam Hall boathouse
looking glum enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now here come some more victims!&rdquo; cried a
Pornell enthusiast, as Dale and his crew appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, we must win!&rdquo; whispered Dale, with
fire in his eyes. &ldquo;We have simply got to do it.
If we don&rsquo;t those Pornell fellows will never get
done crowing over us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win!&rdquo; said Pepper, firmly. &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve
got to do it! Row for all you are worth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boats were soon at the starting-point,
and the rules of the race were explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; was the question put.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence.</p>
<p>Crack! went a pistol, and as the thin smoke
floated over the lake the two crews took the water
with their blades and were off.</p>
<p>Each crew rowed a swift, clear stroke, and for
the first half-mile the two boats kept side by side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a tie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! the Pornell boat is crawling ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Pornell&rsquo;s race too! Boys, this is our
winning day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t crow so soon,&rdquo; said Joe Nelson,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Pornell is going to win,&rdquo; growled Reff
Ritter. &ldquo;Jack Ruddy and those chaps can&rsquo;t
row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can row better than you can,&rdquo; put in
Bart Conners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; grumbled Ritter, and walked to another
point of the boathouse float.</p>
<p>At the end of the first mile Pornell was slightly
in advance. Seeing this, Dale increased the
stroke, and at a mile and a quarter the boats were
once again side by side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Putnam Hall is crawling up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll win out yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull, Pornell, pull!&rdquo; was the yell from the
rival academy lads, and the Pornell boys did pull,
the perspiration streaming down the faces of Roy
Bock and his cronies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! this is a pace!&rdquo; panted Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk!&rdquo; came shortly from Dale. &ldquo;Pull!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he increased the stroke and Pornell did
the same. A quarter of a mile was covered and
Pornell was exactly half a boat&rsquo;s length in the
lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Pornell&rsquo;s race!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for Roy Bock and his crew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a great day for Pornell Academy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go home, Putnam, and learn how to row!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>The cries continued as the Pornell boat continued
to forge ahead until it was nearly two
lengths in advance. But the pace was beginning
to tell on the rowers, and the fellow named Grimes
was breathing with difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it up&mdash;don&rsquo;t give in yet!&rdquo; cried Roy
Bock. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost done! Pull!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grimes tried to do so, and so did another fellow
named Passmore. But they were &ldquo;all in,&rdquo;
as it is called, and could not add an ounce of
strength to their stroke. Roy Bock was also almost
gone, and for the instant the stroke was
broken.</p>
<p>It was a chance that Dale had been looking for,
and he was quick to take advantage of it. He
called on his crew in a sharp way that caused them
to brace up, and the stroke was increased wonderfully.
Up crawled the Putnam Hall crew,
until the other boat was but a quarter of a length
ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys, now, and the race is ours!&rdquo; sang
out Dale, and they gave a spurt. The line was
about a hundred and fifty feet away, and
<a href="#pic1">over this they shot&mdash;the winners</a>
by a length and an eighth!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">TARGET PRACTICE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! Putnam Hall wins the race!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a dandy, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our boys rowed for all they were worth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yells and cheers rent the air and there was a
tooting of horns and whistles.</p>
<p>It was certainly a great victory for Putnam
Hall, and Captain Putnam and George Strong
were correspondingly proud. As usual Josiah
Crabtree kept in the background, for he thought
all such contests foolish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I congratulate you,&rdquo; the captain said to Dale
and the others. &ldquo;You deserve a great deal of
credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won because you kept at it to the end,&rdquo;
said George Strong.</p>
<p>Dan Baxter and his cronies were not happy.
The victory of our friends seemed to make their
defeat worse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they&rsquo;ll crow over us for keeps now,&rdquo;
said Coulter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, these races don&rsquo;t amount to much anyway,&rdquo;
put in Reff Ritter, with a yawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they crow over me I&rsquo;ll shut &rsquo;em up,&rdquo; said
Dan Baxter, savagely.</p>
<p>That evening the cadets of Putnam Hall held a
celebration on the campus, and Jack, Pepper, and
their chums were in high spirits. Baxter and his
crowd did not show themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Baxter!&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;He must feel
sore all over&mdash;after the way he blowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it will teach him a lesson not to do
so much blowing in the future,&rdquo; came from
Stuffer.</p>
<p>A campus fire had been lit, and around this the
boys danced and sang songs. The barrels were
piled high, so that the illumination could be seen
a long distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish the Fords had been here to see the
race,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And our folks,&rdquo; returned Jack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have
to send a full account in the next letters we write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harry Blossom took some photos,&rdquo; said
Stuffer. &ldquo;He said he would let us each have
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for the first lieutenant of Company A!&rdquo;
cried Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, here comes Peleg Snuggers!&rdquo; cried
Andy. &ldquo;Now for some fun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>The cue was quickly taken up by the others, and
in a trice the general-utility man was surrounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Peleg, we want you to make a speech!&rdquo;
cried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know nuthin&rsquo; about makin&rsquo; speeches,&rdquo;
grumbled the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you do,&rdquo; put in Andy. &ldquo;Come now,
that&rsquo;s a good man. Get upon the box!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put him on this barrel!&rdquo; said Stuffer, with a
wink at his friends.</p>
<p>In a twinkling Peleg Snuggers was lifted up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! hi! let me go!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
to stand on no barrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be good for your health, Peleg,&rdquo; said
another cadet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up he goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The general-utility man was placed on the
barrel, which stood on a box. The outfit was a
decidedly shaky one, and poor Peleg trembled
from head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a-goin&rsquo; over!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m
a-goin&rsquo; over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, old boy!&rdquo; sang out a cadet. &ldquo;Think
you&rsquo;re in a circus, doing the great balancing act?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no circus actur, I ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the speech,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll begin
it for you. Friends, debtors, and fellow-countrymen:
On this sad and joyous occasion, it makes
us smile in tears to see so many ugly but handsome
faces looking towards and away from us.
There you are. Now go ahead, proceed, start,
and begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make no speech, I tell you!&rdquo; roared the
general-utility man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Peleg, you make me cry!&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;Please go on, that&rsquo;s a dear good fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead and we&rsquo;ll present you with a bunch
of rhubarb blossoms,&rdquo; said Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; measure yer head fer a golden crown,
so we will!&rdquo; added Emerald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he can&rsquo;t talk we&rsquo;ll have to warm him up!&rdquo;
said another student, and waved a torch towards
Snuggers.</p>
<p>This was a signal for all the boys to get torches,
and soon they formed a circle around the barrel,
each with a torch extended towards poor Peleg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you burn me!&rdquo; shrieked the unfortunate
utility man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speech! speech!&rdquo; was the cry, and the boys
came a little closer with their torches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speech! speech!&rdquo; And the boys came still
closer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;oh, gracious! Don&rsquo;t burn me, I tell
you! Keep back!&rdquo; The sweat was pouring from
the man&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash; Well, here goes!
This here school is the best in the world. You
fellers is the best in&mdash;keep back with that torch!
You fellers is the worst&mdash;I mean the best in the
world. I&rsquo;m glad to serve you, but I&rsquo;d be gladder
if you&rsquo;d leave me&mdash;get back, I say! It&rsquo;s been a
juberous day, and we are all&mdash;we&mdash;are all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Overflowing with joy,&rdquo; suggested Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t overflowing with joy&mdash;oh, get back!
Yes, I am, and this glorious school&mdash;&mdash; Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speech came to a sudden end, as the top of
the barrel gave a crack. Down went the general-utility
man into the barrel, which rolled from the
box to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;Peleg wants a roll!
Let&rsquo;s give it to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the poor man, but
could say no more. Over and over went the barrel,
around the campus, with Snuggers in it, the
cadets shrieking wildly with joy. Then down the
hill to the rear it went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going into the lake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he swim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; into the lake!&rdquo; screamed Peleg
Snuggers, and clutched at some tufts of grass as
he passed. This served to turn the barrel in a
different direction, and it brought up against a
tree with a bang. Then the general-utility man
crawled out and ran for the barn. He did not
show himself again for the balance of that evening.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>The fun was carried into the school, and late
that evening there were several pillow-fights
which George Strong and Josiah Crabtree had to
stop. In the mix-up one of the pillows burst
open, and Crabtree got all the feathers over his
head and had to beat a retreat. But by midnight
the fun came to an end and the school became as
quiet as usual.</p>
<p>During the following week the boys had something
to do which pleased the majority of them
a great deal. For three afternoons of the week
a part of each company went out for target practice.
The targets were set up in a field some
distance from the lake, where it would be perfectly
safe to shoot at them. Each student was
given five shots, and if he was a poor marksman
Captain Putnam took it upon himself to teach the
lad how to shoot better.</p>
<p>Jack, Andy, and Dale went out together, and
the youthful major of the battalion was lucky
enough to make forty-seven points out of a possible
fifty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very good, Major Ruddy,&rdquo; said Captain
Putnam. &ldquo;I am glad to know that our
major can shoot so well.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose a commander ought to know
something about it,&rdquo; answered Jack, modestly.</p>
<p>When it came Andy&rsquo;s turn to shoot, the acrobatic
lad made forty-one out of a possible fifty.
This was not so high, but as thirty-five was considered
the passing mark there was no complaint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose it could be worse,&rdquo; was
Andy&rsquo;s comment. He had been afraid that
he would not pass, for he did very little shooting.</p>
<p>Reff Ritter was the next student up, and by
luck more than anything else he made forty-three
points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned to shoot in Paris,&rdquo; he said, loudly.
&ldquo;A French expert taught me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was very good,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam,
quietly.</p>
<p>Gus Coulter came next and at first failed to hit
the target. His total was twenty-eight points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to give you a few lessons in shooting,&rdquo;
said the master of the Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The&mdash;er&mdash;the wind was too strong,&rdquo; grumbled
Coulter.</p>
<p>At that moment came a wild cry from one side
of the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mad dog! Mad dog! Save me! Save
me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">ABOUT A MAD DOG</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the mad dog?&rdquo; cried Dan Baxter,
in alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; shouted Gus Coulter, turning
pale. &ldquo;Oh, I do hope he doesn&rsquo;t come this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of the cadets and the others present looked
in the direction from whence the cries proceeded.
They saw a middle-aged woman running along a
footpath to the side of the field. Behind her was
a big dog, who was frothing at the mouth and
snapping his teeth together viciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me! Save me from the dog!&rdquo; cried the
woman. She was evidently some farmer&rsquo;s wife
who lived in the neighborhood. She had been
carrying a basket, but had thrown the article at
the dog, in a weak effort to stay his progress.</p>
<p>When the alarm came Jack had one of the rifles
in his hand. It was loaded, and now he turned
quickly with the weapon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take care! Don&rsquo;t hit the woman!&rdquo; began
Captain Putnam, when the crack of the weapon
cut short his warning. Taking hasty aim, the
young major had fired at the mad animal. A
yelp followed, the dog leaped high in the air, and
then came down and lay still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Jack nailed him!&rdquo; shouted Andy.
&ldquo;A fine shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see if he is dead,&rdquo; said Captain Putnam,
and catching up another rifle he ran forward,
followed by half a dozen cadets. Soon
they reached the woman, who was on the point of
fainting from fright and from running.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he&mdash;he&mdash;dead?&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is dead,&rdquo; announced the master of
the Hall, making a close examination. &ldquo;The bullet
must have gone straight through his brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was mad, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; went on the woman,
recovering a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond a doubt, and very violent, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He scared me nearly to death. When I first
saw him he was tangled up in some old fence-wire.
It seemed to have set him crazy. I tried
to get away from him, but as soon as he got shut
of the wire he came after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was lucky that this young man shot him,&rdquo;
said the captain, and pointed at Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, did he do it?&rdquo; cried the woman. &ldquo;I
thought you did it.&rdquo; She turned to the young
major. &ldquo;I am very much obliged, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you are welcome,&rdquo; said Jack, blushing
like a girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose dog is it?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It belongs to Mr. Haverick, the horse-dealer.
I suppose it was quite valuable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see&mdash;are you not Mrs. Bennington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am. My husband sold you some wood last
winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember. Well, Mrs. Bennington, I
do not know what to do with the dog excepting to
have my man bury him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we had better let Mr. Haverick see
him first. He thought a good deal of the animal.
I&rsquo;ll have my husband tell him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, we&rsquo;ll leave him where he is then&mdash;at
least for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman went on her way slowly, and the
target practice was resumed. It soon became
noised around what Jack had done, and many, including
Pepper and Dale, came out to see the
slain animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was all right, Jack!&rdquo; cried Pepper.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better than hitting the target.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking of something,&rdquo; said Jack,
in a serious tone. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember that
horse-dealer we once met on the boat, down at
Cedarville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the same chap?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. He was very overbearing, and I
am afraid he will try to make trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! He ought to be very glad that
his dog didn&rsquo;t bite somebody,&rdquo; answered the
Imp.</p>
<p>Dan Baxter had been much disturbed by the
appearance of the mad dog, and his nerves were
not yet settled. Consequently, when he came up
to shoot he only made thirty-three out of a possible
fifty points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This rifle is no good!&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;It
doesn&rsquo;t shoot straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the rifle I used,&rdquo; said a student who had
made forty-six points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I used it too,&rdquo; said another, who had
made forty-two points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, it doesn&rsquo;t shoot straight,&rdquo;
growled the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not hold the rifle just right, Baxter,&rdquo;
said Captain Putnam. &ldquo;Take it this way,&rdquo; and
he illustrated what he was saying.</p>
<p>Jack was right when he said the horse-dealer,
Haverick, would try to make trouble. Early the
following morning the man called at the Hall
and demanded to see Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand one of your scholars shot my
dog,&rdquo; said Sam Haverick. His face wore a deep
scowl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are Mr. Haverick, the horse-dealer?&rdquo;
questioned the captain, politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the dog was shot because he was mad and
wanted to bite Mrs. Bennington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t mad at all! He was playful, that&rsquo;s
all. That dog cost me fifty dollars. Somebody
has got to pay for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I shall pay for him,&rdquo; said the
captain, stiffly. &ldquo;He was mad beyond a doubt,
and had to be shot. Had he bitten Mrs. Bennington
it might have made a lot of trouble for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! I say he wasn&rsquo;t mad. I want pay for
the dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not get it from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll sue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is your privilege,&rdquo; answered Captain
Putnam, with a shrug of his broad shoulders.
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll gain anything by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll have the boy who shot the dog arrested,&rdquo;
went on Sam Haverick, roughly.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s manner made the captain angry, and
he stiffened up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do that, sir, I&rsquo;ll have you arrested also,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&mdash;for allowing a mad dog at large.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s manner did not suit the horse-dealer.
He saw that he could not bulldoze the
master of the Hall, and his manner changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you ain&rsquo;t going to pay no damages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a cent. I do not think you are entitled
to anything. If I thought you were I&rsquo;d settle
in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see! We&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo; grumbled Haverick,
and stalked out of the building much discomfited.</p>
<p>As soon as the horse-dealer was gone, Captain
Putnam called Jack into his private office and related
what had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be alarmed, in case he tries to do anything,&rdquo;
said the captain. &ldquo;I will protect you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can he do anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can make us a little trouble, that is all.
He is a foolish man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The horse-dealer consulted a lawyer. But the
legal light gave him small hope, and he finally
concluded that he would not bring suit nor would
he have Jack arrested. But he was very bitter,
and vowed that sooner or later he would &ldquo;make
Captain Putnam smart, and that young cub of a
shooter, too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>On the following Saturday Jack, Pepper, and
Dale went on a long tramp over the hills with
George Strong. The teacher was looking for
certain botanical specimens, and the boys assisted
him all they could. The lads were glad to go
out with the second assistant teacher, for his
talks were always of interest and profit. By going
with him they learned more of botany and
geology than they did from their schoolbooks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Mr. Strong,&rdquo; said Jack, as they
were coming home, &ldquo;have you learned anything
more concerning that hidden pot of gold that your
ancestors buried during the Revolutionary War?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a great deal, Ruddy. I have gained what
looks like a clew to me. That is, that the pot of
gold was buried in the hills some distance to the
south of this spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have no idea of the exact location?&rdquo;
said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not. If I had I&rsquo;d certainly go and dig
for it.&rdquo; And George Strong gave a short laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you get time you ought to organize a
regular treasure hunt,&rdquo; put in Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking of that. But I do not like
to waste time on a wild-goose chase,&rdquo; answered
the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has become of those crazy men, Bart
Callax and Paul Shaff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe they are still out west, under the
care of a distant relative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t want to meet them again,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, never!&rdquo; said George Strong, with a
shiver. He had not yet forgotten his terrible
experience with his insane relatives.</p>
<p>The party of four had made a long detour and
were returning to the Hall by a route that was
somewhat new to them. They had a large hill
to cross, the other side of which was filled with
thick trees growing among some large rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is wild enough for anything,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there was any ground
around here so rough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful that you don&rsquo;t sprain an ankle,&rdquo;
cautioned the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; cried Dale, coming to a
sudden halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cave!&rdquo; ejaculated Pepper. &ldquo;A regular
cave,&rdquo; he added, peering into the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s explore it,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
time enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Strong was willing, and a minute later
the exploration of the cave began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">IN THE CAVE</span></h2>
<p>The cave was an irregular one of uncertain
depth. The opening lay under a big, jagged
rock, with other rocks on either side. One after
another they passed into the underground chamber
without much trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather dark,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better
light a torch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said the teacher, and went out
and got a pine branch. This burnt very well, although
it made quite some smoke. They advanced
with caution, for the cave was not very
high and nobody wanted to strike his head on the
sharp rocks above. In some places the tree-roots
hung down like so many snakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, I wonder if there are any snakes
in here?&rdquo; observed Dale, when from under a
rock glided a reptile about two feet long, followed
by another a trifle smaller. Dale let out a yell
and retreated, and so did the other boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are harmless,&rdquo; called out George Strong.
&ldquo;They are common wood-snakes. See, they have
crawled out of sight already. They are more
scared than you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say I hate snakes,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I am
willing to leave them alone if only they will leave
me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble is, most folks know very little
about snakes,&rdquo; said the teacher. &ldquo;Why, a snake
can be made a great pet, just like a cat or a dog,
or a bird. Many snake-charmers really make
pets of their snakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, I&rsquo;d rather have a dog or a bird
any day,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or even an old tomcat,&rdquo; put in Pepper.</p>
<p>The cave was not very wide, indeed it seemed
to be merely a split in the rocks and dirt. In one
spot the tree-roots were so thick the party had to
literally force its way along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; came in a warning from George
Strong. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get stuck so tight that you can&rsquo;t
get out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look out for that,&rdquo; said Pepper who was
in advance.</p>
<p>Presently they reached a spot where the cave
divided into three parts. At the bottom of one
part flowed a spring of clear, cold water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is fine!&rdquo; declared Dale, after taking a
drink.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look out that you don&rsquo;t swallow a lizard,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you what,&rdquo; declared Pepper, gazing
around by the light of the smoky torch, &ldquo;this
would make quite a retreat if it was cleaned out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last they could go no further and began to
retrace their steps. At one point they had to
crawl over some rocks and under some tree-roots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder if I can push the tree up?&rdquo; cried Dale,
by way of a joke, and pressed upward with his
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care!&rdquo; cried George Strong, &ldquo;You may
loosen something and get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rock is shifting!&rdquo; yelled Jack. &ldquo;Look
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a grinding, and all saw that a rock
above them was settling down. The teacher,
Jack, and Pepper ran in one direction and Dale
in another.</p>
<p>An awful noise followed, and the loose dirt
flew in all directions. For a minute all were
greatly confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you boys hurt?&rdquo; was the first question
asked by the assistant teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; added Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Dale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He slipped back, the way he had come.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dale! Dale!&rdquo; shouted the teacher. No answer
came back to the summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he was killed!&rdquo; gasped Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; came from Jack. &ldquo;Dale!
Dale!&rdquo; he went on loudly.</p>
<p>Still there was no answer, and now all became
thoroughly alarmed. George Strong moved over
to the rock that had fallen and examined it with
care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he is under this,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;But he may be caught in some way on the other
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are we to get at him?&rdquo; was the question
from Pepper.</p>
<p>The torch was dying down and Jack had to
work his way out of the cave and find a new pine
bough for a light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we can get at him from the top,&rdquo; suggested
Jack. &ldquo;There seemed to be quite a cave-in
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will look,&rdquo; said the teacher.</p>
<p>All hurried outside and to the spot the young
major had noticed. The ground was much
sunken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is literally buried alive!&rdquo; cried George,
Strong. &ldquo;We must dig him out, and be quick
about it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>They went at the stones and dirt with vigor, yet
taking care that no additional cave-in should result.
All they had to work with was a trowel
George Strong had brought along and their
hands, but despite this drawback they made fair
progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a hole!&rdquo; cried Jack, after five minutes of
hard work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo; cautioned George Strong again.
&ldquo;Call down to Dale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young major did so, but still there was no
answer. The hole was increased in size until it
was big enough to admit the passage of a human
form. Then the torch was flared below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see him!&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;He is flat on his
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he seem to be caught by the rocks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher took a look and then ordered that
the hole be made a little larger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will lower myself to him,&rdquo; said George
Strong. &ldquo;Then I will pass him up to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He disappeared into the hole and took the torch
with him. Presently he called out, and then they
saw him lifting up Dale&rsquo;s limp form. They
caught hold of their chum&rsquo;s body and drew it to
a place of safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to be knocked unconscious,&rdquo; said
Jack, soberly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>They assisted the teacher to the surface above
the cave, and then all three turned their attention
to Dale. There was a lump on the unconscious
boy&rsquo;s head and a scratch on his chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get some water and we&rsquo;ll bathe him,&rdquo; said
George Strong, and this was done, and presently
Dale opened his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it away!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too
heavy for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all right, Dale,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
safe.&rdquo; And then Dale stared around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what did you say?&rdquo; he stammered.
&ldquo;Oh, my head!&rdquo; And he put up his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are safe,&rdquo; said the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t that rock come down on me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came pretty close to you. It must have
grazed your head, and that is what made you unconscious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how&mdash;how did I get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We dug you out,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; And for the time being the suffering
youth said no more.</p>
<p>They continued to bathe his face and wrists,
and presently he said he felt better. But George
Strong made him wait half an hour before standing
on his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit dizzy and light-headed, but that&rsquo;s
all,&rdquo; declared Dale, when they finally set out for
Putnam Hall. &ldquo;Say, I reckon I had a narrow
escape, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; answered the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you caught at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I get for trying to lift up a tree,&rdquo;
pursued Dale, with a sorry little grin. &ldquo;No more
such foolishness for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took their time about getting back, and it
was long after the supper hour when the academy
was reached. George Strong explained matters
to Captain Putnam and they had the meal in
private.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was certainly quite an adventure,&rdquo; remarked
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and one I shouldn&rsquo;t wish to experience
again,&rdquo; answered Dale. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t go into another
cave in a hurry, take my word on that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the cave was ever used for anything?&rdquo;
asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think so,&rdquo; returned George Strong.
&ldquo;It was merely a split in the rocks, probably
caused by a landslide.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">SEEN THROUGH A SPYGLASS</span></h2>
<p>Three days later Jack came to Pepper, Andy,
and Dale, who were out on the campus catching
ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Strong is in trouble,&rdquo; he announced, and
the ball catching came to an end at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody I think has been playing tricks on
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order a lot of things in his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Andy,
with a puzzled look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Day before yesterday there came an elegant
set of Cooper&rsquo;s works by express with a C. O. D.
charge of thirty-two dollars. Mr. Strong never
ordered the books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s mean, to play a trick like that on him,&rdquo;
said Dale. &ldquo;Now if it was old Crabtree I
wouldn&rsquo;t say a word.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday came a bookcase, also C. O. D., at
eighteen dollars, and then he got three fountain
pens by mail, with a bill for twelve dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he any idea who ordered the things?&rdquo;
asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest idea in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he was very much annoyed and could
not imagine who would be mean enough to play
such tricks on him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they signed his name to the orders that
would be forgery,&rdquo; was Dale&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t he send for the orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is going to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second assistant teacher was indeed in
trouble. On the day following the above conversation
a parrot arrived in a cage for him, followed
by a canary bird. Then came a canoe and
a rifle, both, sent &ldquo;on approval.&rdquo; The next day
he got a letter from a city firm, asking how
he wished them to send the automobile that he
desired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is too much!&rdquo; said the teacher, as he read
the letter to Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an outrage,&rdquo; answered the master of the
Hall, warmly. &ldquo;We must find out who is up to
these tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will keep me busy a long time explaining
matters,&rdquo; went on George Strong, with a troubled
look on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better refuse all goods after this,
unless you are certain they are all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day seemed to cap the climax, for that
morning there came a crate of dishes, two boxes
of mineral water of the most expensive kind, and
a folding baby carriage. George Strong was
desperate and refused to accept anything, despite
the protestation of the express driver from Cedarville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t order the things and I won&rsquo;t accept
them!&rdquo; cried the teacher. &ldquo;Send them back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And about the charges?&rdquo; asked the expressman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collect at the other end. I have nothing
whatever to do with the orders.&rdquo; And the expressman
went away grumbling loudly to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>As was to be expected, the refusal to accept
goods brought a great deal of trouble. George
Strong received some harsh letters and in some
cases was threatened with suits-at-law. In three
instances he received the original orders for inspection,
but they were poorly written, in pencil,
and he could make little or nothing out of them.
Goods had been sent to him because he referred
to Captain Putnam as to his responsibility to
make payments. This brought the master of the
Hall into the mix-up, and he had to do what he
could to explain matters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must certainly locate the party or parties
who are guilty,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Mr. Strong,
have you any especial enemies among the students?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not, captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had occasion to reprimand any of
them, or keep them in after regular hours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I have kept some of them in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher named over seven or eight, among
them being Reff Ritter, Dan Baxter, and Gus
Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I once had to keep in Dale Blackmore and
Andy Snow for talking together. But I do not
think they can be guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, although Snow is rather full of
fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The matter was talked over and the teacher
said he would watch the boys he had mentioned
closely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>On the following Saturday Jack and Andy got
permission to go to Top Rock Hill, located not
many miles from the academy. They wanted
some of the others to go along, but there was a
&ldquo;scrub&rdquo; baseball game on and they declined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember how Baxter got into trouble
at Top Rock Hill last fall?&rdquo; said Jack, as they
trudged along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I do, Jack,&rdquo; returned Andy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think he&rsquo;ll try to take any more nuts from private
property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack had with him a new spyglass and wanted
to test it. The boys climbed to the very top of
the hill, where a grand panorama was spread before
them. On one side were the rolling hills and
on the other the slope running down to the lake,
which lay glistening like silver in its rim of
green.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see the Hall with this glass,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;And I can see some of the fellows out on the
lake in boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He allowed Andy to take a look, and after a
while they turned the glass in the direction of
the somewhat dusty road that wound around the
foot of Top Rock Hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see a buggy coming along the road,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;There is a man in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy took a look at the turnout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that is one of our horses!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;The spotted white, Billy Boy. Can it be the
captain who is out driving?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, he was in his office when we came away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it is old Crabtree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is Mr. Strong by his hat,&rdquo; said Jack,
handling the glass. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see his face very
clearly. He is slowing up and&mdash;&mdash; Well, I declare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack stopped suddenly and gave another long
look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See! see!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Two men are on
the road. What are they doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to be quarreling with the carriage
driver,&rdquo; answered Andy. &ldquo;They are hauling him
out of the carriage, and, yes, it is Mr. Strong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is in trouble, we ought to help him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are! Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shutting up the spyglass, the two cadets hurried
from the top of the hill in the direction of the
wagon-road. The way was rough and uncertain
and they had to beware of dangerous holes.
Once they got caught in a tangle of bushes and
had to go back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we are not losing the right direction,&rdquo;
panted Andy, as he paused to gaze round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all right,&rdquo; answered the young major.
&ldquo;Hurry up! He may be in peril of his life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last they gained the bottom of the rocky hill.
There was a small meadow to cross, beyond which
was the wagon-road, lined with trees and bushes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; they heard somebody cry. &ldquo;Help!
help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is Mr. Strong&rsquo;s voice!&rdquo; exclaimed Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see the horse and carriage!&rdquo; answered Jack,
pointing down the road. &ldquo;Look, the carriage is
empty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the horse is running away!&rdquo; finished his
chum, as they saw the steed dash onward at a
gallop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; came the cry again. Both boys
looked around, but could see no one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we call to him?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; answered Jack, hastily. &ldquo;That will
put his assailants on guard. Come, the cry came
from yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forward the two boys darted once more, and
then Andy called a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t anything in the way of weapons,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Let us get clubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This advice was followed promptly. Fortunately
heavy sticks were readily to be had, so
but little time was lost. Then, as they heard
another cry, they darted into a thicket along the
roadside.</p>
<p>A moment later they came upon a thrilling
scene. George Strong was in the grasp of one
man, who held him from the back, while a second
man was going through his pockets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX
<br /><span class="small">ANOTHER CHALLENGE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I know those fellows!&rdquo; whispered Jack, as
he and Andy came to a halt behind convenient
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I. They are Mr. Strong&rsquo;s two crazy
relatives, Bart Callax and Paul Shaff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cadets hardly knew what to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want that million dollars!&rdquo; cried the man
named Callax. &ldquo;Give it to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I want the order for an airship,&rdquo; put in
Paul Shaff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bart! Paul! Let me go!&rdquo; said George
Strong. &ldquo;You are making a mistake, I tell
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t give us what we want we&rsquo;ll tie
you to a tree and burn you up!&rdquo; cried Shaff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are certainly crazy,&rdquo; whispered Andy.
&ldquo;They ought to be in an asylum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how they got here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ran away from those other relatives in the
west, I suppose,&rdquo; returned the young major, and
he spoke the exact truth. The relatives had been
looking all over for the crazy men, but without
success.</p>
<p>Suddenly the two crazy men threw George
Strong flat on his back and began to beat him
with their fists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, we must do what we can!&rdquo; cried Jack,
and ran forward.</p>
<p>The man named Callax was closest to him, and
raising his stick he dealt the fellow a blow that
caused him to fall dazed on the sward.</p>
<p>At the same time Andy hit Paul Shaff a glancing
blow on the shoulder. The crazy man
turned, leaped up, and caught the cadet by the
throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Le&mdash;let go of&mdash;of m&mdash;me!&rdquo; gasped Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys! I am glad you came!&rdquo; burst from
George Strong&rsquo;s lips. He scrambled up and
caught Shaff by the arm. &ldquo;Let him go, do you
hear, Paul! Let him go, I say!&rdquo; And after an
effort he managed to draw the crazy man back.</p>
<p>By this time Bart Callax was getting up. The
blow Jack had dealt seemed to take much of the
fight out of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&mdash;don&rsquo;t hit me again!&rdquo; he whined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then leave Mr. Strong alone,&rdquo; answered the
young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want my million dollars!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I want my airship,&rdquo; put in Paul Shaff.
&ldquo;I have an order to go to the North Pole, to get
fifty polar bears for the circus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll behave yourselves I&rsquo;ll see that you get
what is coming to you,&rdquo; said George Strong.
&ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t attack me in this fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad! We are so poor!&rdquo; cried Callax,
and suddenly began to weep. Then Shaff sat on
the ground and looked the picture of despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want to do, Mr. Strong?&rdquo; whispered
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the horse and buggy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The horse ran away, up the road, but maybe I
can find him,&rdquo; answered Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do so, if you can. If it can be done, I
wish to place these poor chaps where they can
do no further harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better place them in a regular asylum after
this,&rdquo; suggested Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No asylum for me!&rdquo; yelled Bart Callax, leaping
up. &ldquo;Good-bye!&rdquo; And he dove into the
bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him!&rdquo; cried the teacher, but it was too
late. In the excitement Paul Shaff also got away,
and that was the last seen of the pair for some
time to come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>In the meantime Andy had gone after the runaway
horse. As he surmised, the steed had not
gone a great distance, and a third of a mile up
the road was found in a hollow, quietly cropping
the grass. Fortunately the buggy was not damaged
in the least, and he had no difficulty in returning
to the scene of the encounter with the
turnout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They came upon me so suddenly that I was
taken off my guard,&rdquo; said the second assistant
teacher, when telling his story. &ldquo;I tried to reason
with them and said I would take them to the
Hall, but they pulled me from the buggy and
dragged me into the wood. They might have
killed me if you had not happened along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to be of service to you,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;But if I were you I&rsquo;d make a strong effort to
catch them. They are too dangerous to be left at
large.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put some officers of the law on their track,&rdquo;
said the teacher, and this was, later on, done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Strong, perhaps this explains it!&rdquo; cried
Jack, as they were driving back to Putnam Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explains what, Ruddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those orders for goods sent out in your name.
Those crazy men might do something like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so!&rdquo; ejaculated the teacher. &ldquo;It never
struck me before. I must look into it without
delay. No doubt they are guilty.&rdquo; And this
proved to be the fact.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>With the coming of warm weather the thoughts
of many of the students had turned to baseball.
Several teams had already been organized, including
one by Reff Ritter. Baxter had wanted
to organize a team, but Ritter got ahead of him.
However, the bully of the Hall was made pitcher,
with Ritter as catcher, so he was content. Coulter
played first-base and Paxton short-stop. They
called themselves the Medals, and issued a challenge
to any team in the school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means us,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Baxter and Ritter
are bound to get ahead of us if they possibly
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the previous summer there had been some
changes made among the boys when playing baseball,
and now a team was made up with Bart
Conners, the captain of Company A, as captain
and short-stop. Jack was pitcher, Dale catcher,
Andy first-base, Pepper second-base, Stuffer
third-base, Hogan center-field, Harry Blossom
right-field, and Henry Lee left-field. Dave
Kearney and two others were substitutes. This
team was called the Browns, for all of the players
got suits of brown. The Ritter and Baxter
crowd procured suits of blue, with red stockings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>After a good deal of talk it was decided that
the Medals and the Browns should play a game
a week later, on a Saturday afternoon. Both
teams at once began to practice vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter is taking private lessons from a professional
pitcher who comes to Cedarville from
Ithaca,&rdquo; said Pepper one day. &ldquo;I got the word
from Hampden, who saw him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Hampden say anything more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said Baxter was going to fool us on a new
kind of a curved ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news was true. From a friend in the city
the bully had gotten the name and address of the
professional pitcher, and the latter was now giving
Baxter as many lessons as the cadet&rsquo;s spare
time would allow.</p>
<p>The new curved ball was a difficult one to pitch,
and had to be delivered by a certain swing of the
wrist and the elbow. At first Baxter could not
&ldquo;get the hang&rdquo; of it, as he said, but presently it
came to him, and then he delivered the ball very
well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it,&rdquo; said the professional
pitcher. &ldquo;Keep it up like that and you will fool
&rsquo;em every inning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I do,&rdquo; answered Dan Baxter. &ldquo;I want
to down that team sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you keep at it, and don&rsquo;t you fear for
results.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>To make sure that the professional was not
humbugging him, the bully pitched for his cronies
in a field away from Putnam Hall. He struck
out Coulter, Paxton, and Sabine in succession,
and Ritter got nothing but an accidental pop
fly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is certainly a great ball to pitch,&rdquo; was
Reff Ritter&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how we can
lose if you keep that up, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep it up, don&rsquo;t worry about that,&rdquo; was
the answer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll beat them if it breaks my arm
to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody in the school was interested in the
coming game, and in private not a few wagers
were made on the result. When the two teams
went out to practice Dan Baxter did not pitch the
new kind of curve, and many thought his work
weak in consequence.</p>
<p>Jack pitched in the regular way, but as soon as
he heard that Dan Baxter was taking lessons from
a professional the young major went at pitching
in earnest and perfected his signals for his catcher,
Dale. Jack could pitch a fairly speedy ball and
also a drop ball that he hoped would prove effective
from time to time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>The day for the game dawned fairly clear.
There were a few clouds in the sky and a breeze
from off the lake. The game was to begin at
three o&rsquo;clock and before that time visitors began
to arrive from Cedarville and elsewhere, including
some students from Pornell Academy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, here is a surprise!&rdquo; cried Andy, pointing
to a big automobile that was coming along
the road. &ldquo;Mr. Ford and his wife, and two
daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do!&rdquo; cried Laura and Flossie, as
the automobile drew closer. &ldquo;Can we come in to
see the game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly you can!&rdquo; answered Jack, warmly,
and took off his cap. &ldquo;We are much pleased to
see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We missed the boat race, but we didn&rsquo;t wish to
miss this&mdash;at least the girls didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Rossmore
Ford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get you good seats,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, but we can stay right in the automobile,&rdquo;
said the wealthy gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We expect you to win!&rdquo; said Laura to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must win!&rdquo; cried Flossie, to the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to try our best,&rdquo; answered
Andy, and the others said practically the same.
Then the boys ran off, for it was time to start
the game.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">ON THE BALL-FIELD</span></h2>
<p>Reff Ritter won the toss-up and sent the
Browns to the bat. Pepper was the first batter
up, and as he took his place at the plate a slight
cheer went up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play!&rdquo; called the umpire, one of the teachers
from another school.</p>
<p>Dan Baxter held the ball a second, looked at
the plate, and let drive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike one!&rdquo; sang out the umpire, although
Pepper had not struck at the sphere.</p>
<p>Again the ball was delivered, and Pepper sent
the bat around as quickly as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came a ball,&mdash;just a little too high. Then
the sphere was delivered once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike three! Batter out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for Baxter! That&rsquo;s the way to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ball shot up at the last instant,&rdquo; said
Pepper to Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be the new curved ball,&rdquo; answered the
the young major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>Hogan was the next to the bat. The Irish lad
was usually a fairly good batsman, and when he
was struck out a cry of wonder went up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter is certainly pitching to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Snow! He&rsquo;ll hit it, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy had two strikes called on him and then
knocked a little foul, right in the catcher&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three out! That was pretty short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Dan Baxter came up and took a seat on
the bench a grin overspread his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em going,&rdquo; said Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; answered the bully. &ldquo;They
won&rsquo;t know where they stand when I get through
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coulter was the first player up for the Medals,
and went out on a foul to third. Then came Paxton,
who reached first on a drive to center. The
next player followed with a fly to second. When
the inning came to an end the Medals had one
run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for the Medals!&rdquo; shouted some of the
students.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we must get on to that curved ball,&rdquo;
said Jack, as Harry Blossom went to the
plate.</p>
<p>But Harry could no more than knock a foul
and then went out on three strikes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Jack!&rdquo; called out Bart. &ldquo;See if you
can&rsquo;t whack it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack grasped his bat firmly and looked at Baxter
sharply. The bully&rsquo;s face wore a sickly grin.
Jack had a strike called on him before he tried to
hit the sphere. Then came another strike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter is going to strike Ruddy out too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use of talking, Dan is a great pitcher this
season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the ball came in, but it was too low and
the umpire called it a ball.</p>
<p>Then the sphere came in just right. Jack saw
it curving and did not bring his bat around until
the last instant. Then followed a bunt, and while
Dan Baxter fumbled with the ball Jack got to
first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, he got to first anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only on a bunt,&rdquo; came from a follower of the
Medals.</p>
<p>The next player at the bat went out on strikes
and the student to follow on a fly to third, and
thus Jack, though he got to third, failed to score.
Then the Baxter and Ritter team came in and
made two runs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that score! Browns 0, Medals 3!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is certainly a winning day for the
Medals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>The friends of the Browns said nothing, but
looked decidedly glum. The next inning resulted
in a goose-egg for each side. At the end of the
fifth inning the score stood Browns 0, Medals 5.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you about that curved ball,&rdquo; said,
Andy. &ldquo;I have been watching Baxter closely.
When his arm goes like this, it&rsquo;s an in-shoot, when
it goes like this it&rsquo;s an out-shoot, and when it is
twisted up like this, it&rsquo;s a drop-ball. Now watch
and see if I am not right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Emerald. &ldquo;I watched it
meself, so I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let us see what good watching did,&rdquo; said
Jack.</p>
<p>Hogan was at the bat, and the Irish lad got two
balls and two strikes. Then came a drop-ball,
but Emerald raised it up far into center-field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; yelled Pepper. &ldquo;Go, Emerald, go!&rdquo;
And go the Irish cadet did, and reached second-base
before the fielder could send the ball up.</p>
<p>Hogan&rsquo;s two-base hit seemed to put new life in
the Browns, and at the end of that inning they
had two runs to their credit. More than that,
they had hit the ball six times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we have solved the mystery of Baxter&rsquo;s
curves,&rdquo; said Bart to his team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we are still behind,&rdquo; said Andy, with
a shrug of his shoulders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t give up yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up? Not a bit of it!&rdquo; cried the acrobatic
youth.</p>
<p>At the end of the seventh inning the score stood
Browns 3, Medals 6. Then came a long-drawn-out
inning, leaving the score at the ending of the
eighth Browns 6, Medals 9.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is our last chance,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;We
must do our level best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An out was made and then two players got their
bases. Then came a ball which Bart himself
lifted to right-field, close to the foul flag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run! Run!&rdquo; yelled the supporters of the
Browns, and run they did, bringing in two runs
and leaving Bart on third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more run and the score will be a tie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a foul!&rdquo; grumbled Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it was a foul!&rdquo; chimed in Dan
Baxter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a fair ball,&rdquo; said the umpire. &ldquo;Perfectly
fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Medals wanted to argue, but the umpire
would not listen. There was a cry from all
around the diamond to &ldquo;Play ball!&rdquo; and the
umpire pulled out his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play in two minutes or forfeit the game,&rdquo; he
said, loudly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>Still grumbling, Dan Baxter walked back to
the box. He sent in a ball with care and the batsman
had a strike called on him. But then came
a safe hit and Bart came in, tying the score, 9 to
9, amid a great cheering.</p>
<p>Pepper was now to the bat, but went out on a
fly to second. Then came Hogan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Emerald, we depend on you,&rdquo; said Bart,
in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t disappoint yez, not me!&rdquo; grunted the
Irish cadet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on to his curves, so I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very first ball came in just as Hogan
wished it. He took a step, landed solidly on the
sphere, and sprinted like mad for first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foul ball!&rdquo; sang out the umpire, when poor
Emerald was halfway to second base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad cess to the foul!&rdquo; panted the batsman, as
he walked slowly back to the home-plate. &ldquo;I
thought I had third sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next ball was too high, and he let it pass.
Then came another just right, and once more the
Irish youth banged away with all of his might.
This time the sphere went down to deep center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run! run!&rdquo; was the yell. &ldquo;Run, Emerald!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show &rsquo;em what an Irish lad can do!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>And Emerald did run, up to third. Then he
saw the second-baseman muff the ball and saw
Dan Baxter start for it, and he tore towards
home. Over the plate he slid&mdash;and the ball came
in&mdash;but just a second too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Browns are one run ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy Snow is up next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t do much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy had a strike called on him and then got
three balls. Evidently Dan Baxter was getting
nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your time, Andy,&rdquo; said Bart. Andy did
take his time, and as a result got four balls and
walked to first-base.</p>
<p>Harry Blossom followed and Andy got to third.
Then came a short hit to first, and Andy came in.
By this time the Browns were highly enthusiastic,
while the Medals were correspondingly dejected.
Dan Baxter &ldquo;went to pieces&rdquo; completely, and
when the Browns finally went out it was with
fourteen runs to their credit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we must pull up,&rdquo; said Ritter, with a
scowl at Dan Baxter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mountain to climb over,&rdquo; grumbled
Coulter.</p>
<p>Jack was on his mettle and did all he could
to steady himself. The first player up to the bat
was struck out, and the second went out on a
foul. Then one got to first on balls and another
followed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Steady, Jack, steady!&rdquo; whispered Pepper.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to pieces as Baxter did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jack, and shut his teeth hard.</p>
<p>With two out the Medals filled the bases, and
then Reff Ritter came to the bat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knock a homer, Reff!&rdquo; shouted one of his
friends. &ldquo;A home run would mean four runs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reff scowled at Jack as he took his place. Jack
looked determined. He threw in the ball with
care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too high!&rdquo; grumbled Ritter.</p>
<p>Again the ball came in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ball one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again the sphere was delivered, and Reff
Ritter struck at it with all his might. It sailed
over Jack&rsquo;s head and seemed bound for center-field,
when like a flash Pepper at second leaped
up and caught it in his left hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! What a fine catch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ends the game!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Browns win! Hurrah!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">MARCHING TO CAMP</span></h2>
<p>For the victory they had won our friends were
warmly congratulated. Many came up and
patted them on the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a dandy catch, Pepper,&rdquo; said Joe Nelson.
&ldquo;I never saw a better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a fine rap of Emerald,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;That set the ball a-rolling for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan Baxter felt thoroughly disgusted at the result
and so did Reff Ritter and the others of the
Medals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have won the game if you hadn&rsquo;t
gone to pieces,&rdquo; grumbled Ritter to the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; answered Baxter. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t any support,&rdquo;
and then he hurried for the Hall and out
of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter certainly pitched well for eight innings,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;One must give him credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as they could get away from their
friends, Jack and his chums walked over to where
Mr. Ford had stationed his automobile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was lovely!&rdquo; cried Laura. &ldquo;I never enjoyed
a game more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so afraid you were going to lose at
first I hardly knew what to do,&rdquo; came from Flossie.
&ldquo;The winning out was grand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must come over to the Lodge, now we
are settled down for the summer,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ford,
and the cadets promised to pay them a visit if they
could manage to get off for that purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are fine people,&rdquo; remarked Andy, as they
watched the departure of the automobile. &ldquo;And
the girls are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peaches,&rdquo; finished Pepper, and then all of the
boys laughed.</p>
<p>During the next two weeks came several more
ball-matches. The Browns played with four
other nines, winning two games and losing two.
The Medals played six games, of which they won
only two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! I&rsquo;ve got news for you fellows!&rdquo;
shouted Jack, as he burst into the gymnasium one
afternoon after a long talk with Captain Putnam.
&ldquo;We are to go into camp for three days, starting
the middle of next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; shouted Dale. &ldquo;That suits me to a
T!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; put in Stuffer. &ldquo;No more hard
lessons in algebra, and language&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And plenty to eat, eh, Stuffer?&rdquo; put in Pepper.
&ldquo;You got more than hardtack when we
were out before, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just bet I did,&mdash;and I had a dandy time,
too,&rdquo; answered Singleton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we to go?&rdquo; questioned Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hasn&rsquo;t been decided on just yet. If he
can arrange it, Captain Putnam is going to let us
go to a spot called Bear Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great C&aelig;sar, I don&rsquo;t want to hunt bears!&rdquo;
cried Harry Blossom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there are any bears on the island
now, although there may have been years ago,&rdquo;
answered the young major.</p>
<p>The news soon spread throughout the school
that they were to go into camp, and all of the students
were correspondingly happy and began to
plan what they would do when on the pleasure
trip. It may be explained here that Captain Putnam
took the cadets out to camp several times
a year, just to give them a taste of army life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be fun in camp,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; answered Andy, with a wink
that meant a great deal.</p>
<p>Andy and Dale were coming through the lower
hall that afternoon when they ran into Mumps.
The toady was almost as white as a sheet and
trembling from head to foot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&mdash;I&rsquo;m so glad I&rsquo;ve met somebody!&rdquo;
gasped Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matters, Mumps?&rdquo; asked Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a burglar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A burglar?&rdquo; cried Andy, and now he was all
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a real burglar. I&mdash;I just saw him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up in the dormitories. He was in Number
3, and then he went into Numbers 6 and 7.
He&mdash;he was packing up all the&mdash;the things!&rdquo;
Mumps was shaking so he could scarcely speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell the captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to, but&mdash;but I was afraid the
burglar would&mdash;would&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch you?&rdquo; asked Dale, and the toady
nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to report this,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;Was
there only one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;guess so, but I&mdash;I am not sure. Oh,
isn&rsquo;t it awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us see for ourselves,&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;I am
not afraid of a burglar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he may shoot you!&rdquo; gasped Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk that. Come, show us where he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk,&rdquo; broke in Andy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
catch him red-handed and turn him over to the
captain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to go back,&rdquo; pleaded the
toady. &ldquo;Bet&mdash;better call Captain Putnam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, Mumps. Where was the fellow
last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In dormitory Number 7.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon root him out!&rdquo; cried Dale, and
leaped up the stairs with Andy at his heels.
&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; And Mumps followed, but at a safe
distance behind.</p>
<p>Dale and Andy approached dormitory Number
7 with caution. It was empty and all of the rugs
from the floor were gone.</p>
<p>A noise in the next room reached them. They
looked in and saw a man kneeling on the floor,
tying half a dozen small rugs into a bundle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the man?&rdquo; asked Andy, stepping back
to Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;yes,&rdquo; stammered the toady. &ldquo;Do&mdash;don&rsquo;t
let him shoot you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mumps, you are the most cowardly fellow I
ever saw in my life,&rdquo; went on the acrobatic youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, some burglars are desperate
characters,&rdquo; whined Mumps. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read of them
shooting people who tried to catch &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man isn&rsquo;t a burglar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; and now the toady&rsquo;s
eyes opened widely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He is the man the captain hired to clean all
the rugs and the carpets in the Hall. While we
are in camp the school is to have a general cleaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; murmured Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fine burglar hunter,&rdquo; said Dale, and
began to laugh. &ldquo;Mumps, you ought to become
a detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t make fun of me,&rdquo; whined the
toady, and ran off with a very red face.</p>
<p>The story was too good to keep, and soon many
of the students knew how Baxter&rsquo;s toady had
thought to trap a burglar, and Mumps was
plagued unmercifully. The man to do the cleaning
also heard of it and laughed as loudly as anybody.</p>
<p>On the following Wednesday morning bright
and early the cadets left Putnam Hall for the
brief encampment. They took with them three
wagons, loaded with tents, cooking utensils, and
provisions.</p>
<p>The battalion certainly presented a fine appearance
when it started off. Every cadet was looking
his best, in a well-brushed uniform with shining
buttons. Each gun and sword was polished
to perfection. Major Jack was at the head, and
he was filled with pardonable pride when he gave
the order to march.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Tap! tap! tap, tap, tap! went the drums, and
then the fifers struck up a shrill and lively air,
and off they moved down the road in the direction
of Lake Smalley, in the center of which was
located Bear Island. The distance to be traveled
was seventeen miles, and they calculated to cover
it before sundown with ease.</p>
<p>The first few miles were over a smooth road,
and good progress was made. Then they struck
a hill, with rather a rough highway beyond, and
the cadets were ordered to take the route step&mdash;that
is, walk as you please. The way was past
many farms and through some small communities,
and many folks came out, to wave handkerchiefs
and give them a cheer. One old lady who
was on her front porch sweeping shook her broom
at them, but did it so pleasantly the cadets had
to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye march well!&rdquo; shouted one old farmer.
&ldquo;Good! Some day ye can all go to war, maybe,
like I did years ago!&rdquo; And he waved a red
bandana at them.</p>
<p>At noon they stopped at a cross-roads hotel
for dinner. Their coming had been arranged
for by Captain Putnam, and they partook of a
good meal of vegetables and rhubarb pie. A
rest of an hour followed, and during that time
some of the boys strolled to the cross-roads general
store and made a few purchases.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>By two o&rsquo;clock the battalion was again on the
march. They now passed through a patch of
timber and then came to a turn in the road, beyond
which were some fields of wheat and corn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, look there!&rdquo; shouted one of the cadets,
and pointed upward. All gazed in the direction
and saw coming toward them a big balloon. It
was settling rapidly, and before the cadets could
get out of the way it came down directly over the
entire battalion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">A NIGHT OF FUN</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never saw such a thing before in my
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did the balloon come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will somebody show me the way out of this
circus tent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody lift!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<p>The cadets did as ordered, some standing their
guns up. The guns acted like short tent-poles,
and the bag of the balloon was thus kept a short
distance from the ground. Slowly one student
after another crawled forth into the open air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is anybody hurt?&rdquo; asked Captain Putnam,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was knocked down,&rdquo; came from Gus Coulter,
and he showed where he had been rolled over
in the dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was nearly smothered,&rdquo; said Mumps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>Nobody had been hurt, although not a few had
been frightened when the weight of the monstrous
bag first settled down upon them. The balloon
was rolled up and placed on one side of the road
and the loose guns picked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess it must be a runaway balloon,&rdquo; suggested
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it has been used for exhibition purposes,&rdquo;
said Captain Putnam. &ldquo;See there is a
trapeze. Probably the performer jumped from
the balloon and used a parachute for reaching the
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there to be an exhibition around here?&rdquo;
asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe one was advertised to take place at
Menville. The wind is blowing from that direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but to leave the balloon
by the roadside, and after a brushing up and
a readjustment of equipments the battalion moved
on once more. Half a mile was covered when
they were halted by two men in a long farm-wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me!&rdquo; shouted one of the men. &ldquo;But
have you seen anything of a balloon around
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say we had,&rdquo; answered Captain Putnam,
who was marching by Jack&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;It
came down in the roadway, directly on our
heads.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What! I reckon you were scared,&rdquo; and the
man grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t care to repeat the experiment,&rdquo;
said the captain, coldly. &ldquo;Some of my students
were knocked down, and if they had not held up
the balloon with their guns they might have been
smothered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said the other man in the
wagon. &ldquo;I am sorry for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I sorry,&rdquo; said the first man who had
spoken. &ldquo;Where is the balloon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About half a mile back on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks; we&rsquo;ll get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose balloon is it?&rdquo; asked Jack, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It belongs to Professor Aireo,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;He made an ascension about an hour ago
at Menville and came down with his parachute.
I hope the balloon is all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appeared to be,&rdquo; answered Jack, and then
the two men drove off and the battalion proceeded
on its way.</p>
<p>The road was rather rough, and two hours
later the cadets came to another halt. A farm-house
was handy and they procured a drink at a
fine old well where the water was both pure and
cold. The farmer, who was present, told them
to help themselves, and as he had a crate of strawberries
ready to take to market, the captain purchased
them and took them along, for use at the
camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>It was nightfall when Smalley Lake was
reached. Some large flatboats were at hand, and
on these the boys were rowed over to the island,
and the camping outfit followed, the wagons and
horses being left at a farm running down to the
lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fine spot for a camp!&rdquo; cried Dale, on
reaching the island.</p>
<p>It certainly was a nice place. The island was
some acres in extent, containing a small grove
of trees, a fine patch of grass, and a bit of
smooth, sandy beach which would be very fine
for bathing.</p>
<p>The tents were pitched on the grass, and after
a rest Captain Putnam allowed some of the boys
to take a dip in the lake. Then campfires were
lit and supper cooked, to which the boys did full
justice, topping off the meal with the strawberries
that had been brought along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ll have any fun to-night,&rdquo;
said Andy. &ldquo;Everybody is too tired.&rdquo; And he
was right. The cadets were glad to rest and
went to sleep without a murmur, only the guards
remaining active. Each cadet had to go on
guard two hours each night, in true military
style.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw! It&rsquo;s raining!&rdquo; cried Pepper, on
rising the following morning. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that too
bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it will last,&rdquo; said Jack, and he
was right. By eight o&rsquo;clock the rain stopped and
soon after the sun came out good and strong, drying
the grass rapidly. Breakfast was had, followed
by a short drill, and then the cadets were
told that they could do as they pleased until
dinner-time. Some went bathing, others fishing,
and a few just lolled around, taking it easy. Baxter
and his crowd strolled off by themselves, to
smoke some cigarettes Reff Ritter had purchased
at the cross-roads hotel on the sly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us take a walk,&rdquo; suggested Dale to Pepper
and some of the others, and soon they were
on the way, going first along the shore and then
into the wood. Here it was cool and pleasant,
and they enjoyed it thoroughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t a fellow have a fine time here if there
wasn&rsquo;t a big crowd?&rdquo; said Dale. &ldquo;Just think of
six or seven of us with the whole island to ourselves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be dandy,&rdquo; answered Andy.</p>
<p>Having rested awhile in the woods, they moved
on, until they came to a sort of shelter among the
rocks. Looking through the bushes they saw
Reff Ritter moving around.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Ritter crowd,&rdquo; said Jack, in a low
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what they are up to?&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;I am going to see.&rdquo; And the Imp moved forward
before anybody could stop him.</p>
<p>When Pepper was close enough he made out
six boys seated in a circle. They were smoking
cigarettes and talking in low but earnest
voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do it,&rdquo; Dan Baxter was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll get caught,&rdquo; put in Mumps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; came from Reff Ritter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a boss plan. We&rsquo;ll carry it out to-night, and
make somebody feel sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better see if anybody is around,&rdquo; cried Gus
Coulter, and leaped up. Pepper had just time
enough to regain his companions when the whole
party was discovered. At once the Baxter crowd
put away their cigarettes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, are you following us?&rdquo; demanded Reff
Ritter, striding forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you are following us,&rdquo; said Pepper,
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should we follow you?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>At this Ritter and Baxter muttered something
the others could not understand. Then the bully
of the Hall and his cronies walked away to another
part of the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are up to something,&rdquo; said Pepper to his
friends, and told what he had heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will pay to watch out to-night,&rdquo; said Dale.</p>
<p>That afternoon the boys had a swimming match,
in which over twenty cadets participated. The
match was won by Harry Blossom, with Andy
second, Bart third, Hogan fourth, and Gus Coulter
fifth. Reff Ritter was in the match, but
dropped out when he saw he could not win.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a cramp in my big toe,&rdquo; he said, but nobody
believed him.</p>
<p>In the evening a happy time was had around the
campfires and at ten o&rsquo;clock the cadets turned in.
Hogan and Stuffer were on guard, along with a
number of others. Each guard had to walk up
and down on his post, and that was all.</p>
<p>Pepper was dozing away when Andy pulled
him by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is doing,&rdquo; whispered the acrobatic
youth.</p>
<p>The Imp was wide-awake on the instant, and so
were Dale and Harry, who were sleeping close
by. Jack, as major, was in another tent.</p>
<p>Some shadows were moving around, and presently
Andy and Pepper saw three cadets steal
into the tent and lift up some uniforms and equipments.
Instantly they leaped up, and caught two
of the intruders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;Drop those
uniforms!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; muttered the other fellow, and
Andy recognized Dan Baxter&rsquo;s voice. Pepper
had Reff Ritter, while Dale got hold of Nick Paxton.
The latter slipped flat on his back and Dale
came down upon him heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Get off of me!&rdquo; grunted Paxton. &ldquo;You
are smashing in my ribs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; demanded Dale, and
caught his prisoner by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a joke,&rdquo; grumbled Paxton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a joke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we were going to hide your uniforms,
that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;Well, it didn&rsquo;t
work, and out you go!&rdquo; And he gave Reff Ritter
a shove that sent him headlong on the ground
outside of the tent. Dan Baxter was also pushed
out, and Paxton was flung on top of the bully.
All three picked themselves up as quickly as they
could and sneaked off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coulter wasn&rsquo;t with them,&rdquo; whispered Pepper.
&ldquo;He and Mumps and Sabine must be trying
the trick elsewhere. Let us go out and investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>The others agreed, and slipping on some clothing
they sallied forth in the darkness. Only a
few stars were shining, so they had to pick their
way with care among the tents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, there is somebody&mdash;coming from Jack&rsquo;s
tent!&rdquo; whispered Pepper, and the next moment
the Imp had a fellow by the collar, while Andy
and Dale caught the second cadet. They were
Coulter and Sabine, and they had Jack&rsquo;s uniform,
his hat, shoes, and likewise the young major&rsquo;s
sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us alone, will you?&rdquo; growled Coulter, in
a cowed tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, we will!&rdquo; cried Pepper. &ldquo;Dale, put
those things back, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Dale did so, Pepper and Andy held Coulter
and Sabine. Jack slept on, totally unconscious
of what was taking place.</p>
<p>Despite their protests, Coulter and Sabine were
made to march back to the tent from which the
other cadets had come. Then they were blindfolded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put them through the forty-fourth degree,&rdquo;
said Pepper.</p>
<p>The others understood what this meant, and in
a twinkling the prisoners had their hands bound
behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; whined Billy Sabine. &ldquo;Please
don&rsquo;t hurt me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t hurt you. Keep still.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t let us go, we&rsquo;ll raise an alarm,&rdquo;
said Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do we&rsquo;ll tell how you tried to steal
Major Ruddy&rsquo;s things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t going to steal them. We were
only going to hide them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It amounts to the same thing. March!&rdquo; said
the Imp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoners were marched to one end of the
camp where there were some low bushes. Then
Pepper began to whisper, but in a voice so that
Coulter and Sabine could hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fix the bayonets all around, and don&rsquo;t forget
to set the traps. That&rsquo;s it, now set that trap too.
If they dare to move, well, they&rsquo;ll wish they
hadn&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to kill them,&rdquo; whispered Dale,
entering into the spirit of the fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t get killed. It will only nip &rsquo;em
pretty bad&mdash;if they move,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>He opened and shut his pocketknife several
times with sharp clicks. Then he announced that
all was ready.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t move&mdash;don&rsquo;t budge&mdash;unless you
want to fall into a sharp trap,&rdquo; said the Imp, to the
two prisoners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ho&mdash;how long must we stay here?&rdquo; asked
Sabine, in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back before sunrise and fix it so
you can get away,&rdquo; answered Andy.</p>
<p>Then the three boys withdrew and left the
two prisoners alone.</p>
<p>Neither Coulter nor Sabine dared to move,
thinking they would run into some sharp steel-trap,
or sword point, and hurt themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is awful!&rdquo; groaned Coulter. &ldquo;Hang the
luck anyway!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we get cut with a rusty trap we may get
lockjaw,&rdquo; groaned Sabine. &ldquo;I heard of a boy
who got caught in a bear-trap once and he died
from blood-poisoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy, Pepper, and Dale watched the prisoners
for a while and then went back to their tent.
Here they were joined by Hogan and Stuffer,
coming in from guard duty.</p>
<p>There was a brief consultation of war, and it
was decided that Baxter, Ritter, and the others
must be paid back for what they had attempted to
do.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">THE GENERAL ALARM</span></h2>
<p>Baxter and his chums were just getting to
sleep, having grown tired of waiting for the return
of Sabine and Coulter, when the bully awoke
with a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he cried, sitting up and rubbing
his eyes.</p>
<p>Before him he saw a curious figure jumping
up and down. It gave forth a curious glow of
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t fool me!&rdquo; he cried, and leaped from
his cot,&mdash;to pitch headlong over an empty barrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; came from Reff Ritter, and he too
got up and bumped into a bag of flour hanging
on a level with his head. Down came the bag,
and the flour flew in all directions, nearly smothering
Mumps, who was still sleeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; spluttered the bully&rsquo;s toady.
&ldquo;Who threw flour over me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He too arose, and fell into a lot of loose tinware,
creating a great racket. Then came a
crash of another sort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, the tent is coming down!&rdquo; called
out Ritter, and tried to get out. But he too fell
over the empty barrel, and the next moment down
came the tent, burying all three of the boys and
making more noise than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run!&rdquo; called out Pepper, who had arranged
the affair, and he and his chums ran and were
soon out of sight.</p>
<p>The noise awoke Captain Putnam and George
Strong, who were sleeping in a tent close by.
Both ran out, and a lantern was lit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble here?&rdquo; demanded the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tent is down,&rdquo; answered George Strong.
&ldquo;Some students&rsquo; fun, I presume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon Baxter, Ritter, and Mumps crawled from
under the collapsed tent, making a great noise
among the tinware as they did so. Then a crowd
began to collect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fenwick! What in the world is the matter
with your face?&rdquo; cried Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s flour, sir,&rdquo; answered Mumps. &ldquo;Somebody
nearly smothered me with flour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They played a trick on us,&rdquo; growled Dan Baxter.
&ldquo;There was a noise and I got up and saw a
make-believe ghost&mdash;some phosphorus on some
dangling shingles. I started to get up, and then
somebody pulled the tent down on our heads.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>Some of the cadets began to snicker at this.
More lanterns were lit, and while some of those
present started to repair the damage that had
been done, Captain Putnam took a lantern and
walked around the camp. Seeing something behind
some bushes, he walked thither and came to
where Coulter and Sabine were still standing
blindfolded and with their hands tied behind
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; asked the master
of the Hall, in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Captain Putnam, is that you?&rdquo; asked
Sabine. &ldquo;Will you help us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are afraid of the traps,&rdquo; said Coulter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Traps? I see no traps,&rdquo; and Captain Putnam
flashed around the rays of his lantern. Then he
set the light down and untied the prisoners&rsquo; hands,
and the cloths over their eyes were also removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; cried Coulter, looking around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a single trap, or a bayonet!&rdquo; murmured
Sabine. &ldquo;We have been fooled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back to your tent at once!&rdquo; cried Captain
Putnam, sharply. &ldquo;I want no more nonsense this
night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>The balance of the night passed quietly enough,
for the cadets were afraid to prowl around, not
knowing who might be on guard. In the morning
there were a good many laughs, but Dan Baxter
and his crowd did not join in.</p>
<p>Down at the general store at the cross-roads
Pepper had purchased some firecrackers and also
some seidlitz powders. Watching his chance
that morning he took the white-paper powders
and dumped them in the milk the Baxter crowd
was using. Then he dumped the other powders
into their sugar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll have some coffee now,&rdquo; said Baxter,
and got himself a cup. Then he put in some of
the doctored milk and followed with some of the
doctored sugar. Several of the others did the
same.</p>
<p>An instant later Baxter&rsquo;s coffee began to bubble
and foam and then went up like a geyser.
The bully was so astonished he let the cup fall
with a smash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! What&rsquo;s up with the coffee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My coffee is going to explode!&rdquo; shrieked
Mumps, and threw his cup in some bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is awful!&rdquo; cried Coulter. &ldquo;Why, what
in the world is the matter with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Ferris, what did you do to that coffee?&rdquo;
demanded Ritter, striding up to the cadet
who had made the beverage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I boiled it, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; answered Ferris. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
good, too,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you put in some baking powder?&rdquo; sneered
Baxter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; and now Ferris himself tasted
some of the coffee he had in his pot. &ldquo;Why,
that&rsquo;s fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me another cup of it,&rdquo; said Baxter.</p>
<p>It certainly looked good and he put in some
milk. Then he added the sugar as before. At
once the coffee bubbled and foamed worse than
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look there!&rdquo; he cried, rushing forward with
the coffee running over the cup and on to the
ground. &ldquo;What do you say to that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Baxter has got Mount Vesuvius brand
of coffee!&rdquo; cried Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you bottle it for mineral water?&rdquo;
asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up!&rdquo; cried the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll try some milk,&rdquo; said Mumps.
&ldquo;Phew, what a flavor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To sweeten it he put in some sugar, and at once
he had the milk boiling and foaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what&rsquo;s the matter!&rdquo; cried Reff Ritter.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the milk and sugar that is doctored. Somebody
put seidlitz powders in them!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dump the sugar and milk away,&rdquo; said the
bully, and this was done. Then the crowd had
to get a new lot before they could go ahead with
their meal. Pepper and his chums had a hearty
laugh over the incident.</p>
<p>That night, when Pepper was on guard duty,
he took his package of firecrackers with him and
during his spare time fixed some of the crackers
so that they would have extra long stems, made of
nothing but ordinary cotton cord. Then, when
he was off duty, he placed the firecrackers around
the camp, lighting each fuse as he did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now wait, and you&rsquo;ll see some fun,&rdquo; he whispered
to Andy, Dale, and the others.</p>
<p>For a few minutes there was silence, and then
one of the crackers went off. It was of good size
and the noise sounded like a gun shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corporal of the guard!&rdquo; came the cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What post?&rdquo; was the question asked by the
corporal, as he rushed out of his tent.</p>
<p>He had scarcely spoken when another firecracker
went off with a loud bang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something must surely be wrong,&rdquo; murmured
Captain Putnam, as he sprang up and donned
part of his clothing. &ldquo;There goes another shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran outside and soon found the bewildered
corporal of the guard, who was running around
asking the various pickets who had fired the shots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find where the shots came from,&rdquo; said
the corporal, and just then came two more explosions,
followed by a third.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>As it happened, the explosions came from different
sides of the camp, so Captain Putnam was
as much bewildered as anybody. By this time all
of the cadets were stirring, for it had been ordered
that no shot should be fired unless something was
really wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be thieves in the camp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe some wild beasts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is some bears,&rdquo; said Andy, in a loud
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bears!&rdquo; screamed Mumps, and the cry was
taken up on all sides. &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want to meet
any bears!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! There are no bears on this island,&rdquo;
said Captain Putnam. &ldquo;They must be
shooting at something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go around and investigate,&rdquo; said
George Strong, and brought out his revolver,
while the master of Putnam Hall did the same.</p>
<p>During this time the firecrackers continued to
go off, by ones, twos, and threes. Then came the
explosion of a dozen or more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious, what can this mean?&rdquo; ejaculated
the captain. &ldquo;All of the guards must be
firing at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is a box of cartridges that got on
fire,&rdquo; suggested George Strong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>The corporal of the guard had been out to one
of the posts, when an explosion took place just
behind him, causing him to leap wildly into the
air. He looked back, saw something burning,
and picked it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are!&rdquo; he called, rushing back to
Captain Putnam. &ldquo;I know what is up now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! A firecracker!&rdquo; said the master of
the school. &ldquo;Who is setting them off, Pell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! nothing but firecrackers,&rdquo; said Dan Baxter,
in disgust. &ldquo;I am going to bed again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; added Reff Ritter.</p>
<p>All waited for a few minutes longer, but no
more explosions followed, and finally Captain
Putnam told the cadets to retire, while he and
George Strong took a walk through the camp to
make certain that everything was all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; whispered Andy to his
chums. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to bed yet.&rdquo; And he led
them to the rear of the tent occupied by Dan Baxter
and his cronies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">AN ATTACK AND A FIGHT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s doing, Andy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and see. You won&rsquo;t have to wait long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bully of Putnam Hall and his cronies were
sleepy and soon tumbled on their cots. They had
scarcely gotten under the blankets when a general
cry arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my! I&rsquo;m stuck full of pins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch! Something is sticking me in the middle
of the back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ker-chew! Who&mdash;ker-chew!&mdash;put this&mdash;ker-chew!&mdash;pepper
on my&mdash;ker-chew!&mdash;cot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cot is full of burrs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are thistles in mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Groans and muttered imprecations followed.
Dan Baxter and his cronies were wild with rage.
They had to light a lantern and clean their cots
and blankets with care. The boys outside sneaked
to their own quarters, laughing heartily to themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you do it, Andy?&rdquo; asked Dale.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;While the shooting was going on. I got the
burrs and thistles while I was out walking this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t forget this encampment in a
hurry,&rdquo; said Pepper, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out that they don&rsquo;t pay us back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was other fun afloat that night, but our
friends did not hear of it until morning. Then
Jack brought the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in a pickle now,&rdquo; announced the young
major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Jack?&rdquo; questioned Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every boat is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boats gone!&rdquo; cried Harry Blossom.
&ldquo;Where did they go to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody seems to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they drift away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. Mr. Strong and myself saw that
they were tied up last evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the fellows must have used them,&rdquo;
said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And forgot to tie them fast afterwards,&rdquo; suggested
Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or else they hid the boats just for fun,&rdquo; said
Pepper.</p>
<p>Jack looked at his friends questioningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, boys, please remember that I am the
major at this encampment,&rdquo; he began, seriously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We know it, Jack,&rdquo; said Andy, quickly. &ldquo;I,
for one, know nothing of the boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And neither do I,&rdquo; came from each of the
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it is the work of the Baxter crowd,&rdquo;
said Dale.</p>
<p>Two hours were spent in looking for the boats.
Then a farmer was seen approaching the island
in a small scow which had seen better days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, did you folks lose any boats?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said George Strong, who was near.
&ldquo;All we had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they drifted down to my farm. Shall
I bring &rsquo;em up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it worth, mister?&rdquo; asked the farmer,
who did not believe in working gratuitously.</p>
<p>Captain Putnam was called, and he told the
farmer he would give two dollars to have the
boats brought back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I go along and help, Captain?&rdquo; asked
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you can go, and Conners can go with
you,&rdquo; answered Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>The boys were soon in the scow, and the farmer
took them to the extreme end of the lake. Here
they found all of the boats the school had used,
drifted under some overhanging bushes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are all tied together,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;That
looks as if they were taken away from the island
on purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t take them away, did you?&rdquo; asked
Bart Conners, of the farmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? Not much. I was asleep last night,&rdquo;
was the answer. &ldquo;I heard you shootin&rsquo; over to
the island, but I didn&rsquo;t git up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andy leaped into one of the boats and picked
up a cigarette butt and then another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I know the crowd who did this,&rdquo; said
the acrobatic youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I do too,&rdquo; said Bart, pointedly.
&ldquo;The same crowd that set the old boathouse on
fire, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cadets and the farmer took the boats back
to the island. George Strong came down to inspect
the craft and pay the farmer off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said the teacher, as he saw the remains
of the cigarettes. He said no more, but
later on talked the matter over with Captain Putnam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Saturday night found the cadets back at Putnam
Hall, safe and sound. The march back to
the school had been without special incident. The
walk told on some of the students, and on Sunday
many of them were content to do little but
rest and eat their meals. By the majority the
outing was voted a complete success. Baxter and
his cronies did not appreciate it so much and
wanted to &ldquo;get square&rdquo; with somebody for the
tricks that had been played.</p>
<p>Once more the boys settled down to the regular
routine. Many of them wanted to make a good
showing when it came to the examinations and
so applied themselves diligently to their studies.
But some, including Reff Ritter and Dan Baxter,
cared very little if they came out near the head
or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect to take a trip with my father before
long,&rdquo; said Dan Baxter. &ldquo;I hope he takes me out
of the school before the examinations come off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish I was going away,&rdquo; grumbled Ritter.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty dull these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some reason Dan Baxter got it into his
head that Pepper was responsible for all the
troubles he had had, and one afternoon, when in
a particularly ugly mood, he followed the Imp to
the end of the campus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Ditmore, you are getting pretty fresh,
ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he blustered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Baxter, but I certainly shouldn&rsquo;t
wish to grow stale,&rdquo; answered Pepper, coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the way you are talking about
me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I have talked about you&mdash;at
least, not lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t try to crawl out of it,&rdquo; went
on the bully in a loud tone, while a crowd began
to collect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not crawling out of anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d like me to give you a good licking,
eh?&rdquo; went on Baxter, working himself up
into a rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no desire to fight. But if you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah! Take that!&rdquo; cried the bully, and without
warning hit Pepper a stinging blow on the
chin. The Imp was not prepared for the attack
and went flat on his back on the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For shame, Baxter!&rdquo; cried Harry Blossom,
who had just come up. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t fair at
all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep your oar out!&rdquo; snarled the bully. &ldquo;I
know what I am doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly Pepper rose to his feet, a good deal
dazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had enough?&rdquo; demanded the bully,
striding up with clenched fists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call that fighting fair?&rdquo; asked Pepper,
slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want any gas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baxter you are a bully and a brute!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>The big cadet glared at the speaker in amazement.
Then he made another lunge forward, but
his fist met only the empty air, for Pepper ducked
just in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you!&rdquo; roared Baxter, as he staggered
forward and then recovered himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to fight, but since you force
me to defend myself, why&mdash;take that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Pepper finished he let out with his right
fist and took the bully fairly and squarely in the
ear. Then the Imp swung around his left fist
and it came in contact with Baxter&rsquo;s nose and
made the blood spurt. The bully staggered, but
before he went down there came another blow
that loosened one of his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now have you had enough?&rdquo; asked Pepper,
standing over the fallen form of the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; snarled Baxter, and as quickly as he
could he got on his feet. But the instant he was
up again, Pepper knocked him down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to give you a dose of your own
medicine, Baxter,&rdquo; said the Imp. &ldquo;If you try to
get up again, down you go once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys! boys! what does this mean?&rdquo; came in a
stern voice, and looking up they saw Captain
Putnam approaching.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
<br /><span class="small">JACK MAKES A DISCOVERY</span></h2>
<p>Dan Baxter was evidently much chagrined.
Pepper stood his ground and looked the master
of Putnam Hall squarely in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that fighting is against the
rules of this institution?&rdquo; said Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Putnam, I have not been fighting,&rdquo;
answered Pepper, as coolly as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not fighting? Do you deny that you just
knocked Baxter down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I do not deny it. I knocked him
down twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you do not call that fighting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was walking out here when Baxter came
up. He began to pick a quarrel, and without
warning, as some of these boys can testify, he
struck me in the chin and knocked me flat on my
back. That made me angry and when I got up
he struck at me again. Then I sailed in and
knocked him down twice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t so,&rdquo; muttered Dan Baxter. &ldquo;He
started the quarrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; came from several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It started just as Pepper says,&rdquo; put in Harry.
&ldquo;It was a mean thing for Baxter to attack Pepper
without warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it was,&rdquo; said another student
standing by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows shut up!&rdquo; roared Dan Baxter.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped short in confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you attack him, Baxter?&rdquo; asked the
master of the school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s getting too airish,&rdquo; said the bully,
not stopping to think twice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you admit that you did attack him
first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the bully grew red in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;I had good cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both of you come to my office,&rdquo; said the captain,
and he also asked half a dozen of the others
to come along. At the office the matter was carefully
investigated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ditmore, you may go,&rdquo; said the master of
Putnam Hall. &ldquo;It was not just right for you to
do as you did, yet I do not blame you for defending
yourself. Baxter, you can remain.&rdquo; And
then all left the office but the bully. After the
others had gone Captain Putnam read the bully a
stern lecture. The captain had found out about
the smoking and drinking at the old boathouse,
and told the bully in very plain words that such
practices would not be permitted around the
academy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume the boathouse caught fire by accident,&rdquo;
said Captain Putnam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess it did,&rdquo; said Baxter, meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a mean piece of business all the way
through&mdash;and doubly mean to try to throw suspicion
on some other cadets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did mean things to me, too,&rdquo; grumbled
the bully, and then he was glad to make his escape
from the office.</p>
<p>It made Dan Baxter feel sick to face the school
after his encounter with Pepper. Everybody was
talking of how the Imp had polished off the bully.
Baxter was glad enough when he received a telegram
from his father asking him to leave Putnam
Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going on a trip and I shan&rsquo;t be back for
some time,&rdquo; said Baxter to his cronies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in luck,&rdquo; answered Reff Ritter.
&ldquo;Wish I was going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can, square up with Pepper Ditmore
and his crowd,&rdquo; went on the bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; put in Gus Coulter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>On the very day that Dan Baxter left Putnam
Hall to go on a trip with his father, Pepper, Jack,
and Andy received an invitation from the Fords
to visit their summer home at Point View Lodge,
not many miles away. The day was bright, and
the roads seeming fine they went over on their
bicycles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is where the Bock crowd once held us
up,&rdquo; said Jack, as they were riding through the
woods. &ldquo;Do you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not likely to forget it,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;Nor to forget how we shot the tiger that had
escaped from the circus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which puts me in mind of something,&rdquo; said
Pepper. &ldquo;Do you remember about that balloon
that came down on us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the balloonist, Professor Aireo, is going
to give an exhibition next Saturday at Datport,
in connection with some sort of soldiers&rsquo; reunion.
I&rsquo;d like to ride over and see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us do it&mdash;if we can get off,&rdquo; returned
Andy; and so it was agreed.</p>
<p>When the boys arrived at the Ford mansion
they found all of the family there to greet them.
Refreshments were served, and then the young
people went out in the garden to play croquet and
lawn tennis. The girls wanted to know about
their life in camp, and smiled when told of the
tricks that had been played.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly do have good times,&rdquo; said
Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ever see any more of Roy Bock and
his crowd?&rdquo; asked Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and we don&rsquo;t wish to see them,&rdquo; answered
Flossie, with a toss of her curly head.</p>
<p>After the games there was music on the piano
and singing, and then some more refreshments,
and all too quickly it was time for the boys to
return to the Hall. All said they had had a splendid
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ford. &ldquo;And
do not forget to come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was still light when the boys leaped on their
bicycles and started along the forest road for Putnam
Hall. All were in high spirits, and Andy,
in front, set a pace which the others followed
with difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; sang out Jack. &ldquo;This road is
none of the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; answered the acrobatic
youth. &ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; And he pushed ahead as
hard as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think this road is better than it used to be,&rdquo;
said Pepper, after a mile and a half had been covered.
&ldquo;They must have&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>A crash ahead caused him to cut his speech
short. They saw Andy fly over the handle-bars
of his machine and land in some thick bushes.
The bicycle spun around in the roadway and then
fell, with the front wheel completely wrecked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt, Andy?&rdquo; asked Jack, slackening
his pace just in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think I am,&rdquo; was the slow reply,
as the acrobatic youth climbed out of the brushwood.
&ldquo;Gosh! but that was a header, wasn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; asked Pepper, who had
gone ahead and now came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got in a rut and that threw me against
yonder rock. I suppose I can be thankful that I
didn&rsquo;t break my neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The front wheel is done for,&rdquo; said Jack, examining
the bicycle. &ldquo;The spokes and the rim
are both smashed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I reckon I&rsquo;ll have to walk home,&rdquo; said
Andy, ruefully. &ldquo;I reckon the old saying is true,
&lsquo;The more haste the less speed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can take turns at carrying you,&rdquo; said
Jack. &ldquo;One can carry you and the other the
broken wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you do it&mdash;on such a road as this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can try it, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>Andy got on the rear of Pepper&rsquo;s bicycle and
went on ahead, and Jack placed the broken wheel
on his shoulder and followed on his own machine.
Progress was slow, and long before the Hall was
reached it was dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us rest awhile,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;This is
hard work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll work one of the wheels for awhile,&rdquo; said
Andy&mdash;&ldquo;that is, when we start again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys sat down by the side of the forest
road to rest. Near by a tiny brook of cold water
was trickling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be a spring near by,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;If there is, I&rsquo;m going to have a drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ditto myself,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>Jack walked off to look for the spring. He
was gone only a few minutes when he came back
in high excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a discovery!&rdquo; he cried, softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of a discovery?&rdquo; asked Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I followed up the brook until I came to the
spring, under a big overhanging rock. I was
stooping down for a drink, when I caught the
gleam of a campfire, through the trees. After I
had my fill, I walked closer to the campfire to
investigate. There I saw those two crazy relatives
of Mr. Strong, Paul Shaff and Bart Callax!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<h2 id="c26">CHAPTER XXVI
<br /><span class="small">THE MEN IN THE WOODS</span></h2>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s announcement filled Andy and Pepper
with surprise. They had not dreamed that the
two missing men could be anywhere in that vicinity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t make any mistake?&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you can go and see for yourself. They
have a regular camp located there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other boys were curious, and followed the
young major along the brook and to the campfire
beyond. True enough, Shaff and Callax
were there, taking it easy beside the campfire.
They had built themselves a rude shelter of tree-boughs
and brushwood, in front of which was a
beautiful rug. In front of a tree hung a looking-glass
and on a bench rested a washbowl and a
shoe-blacking outfit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay low&mdash;we don&rsquo;t want them to spot us,&rdquo;
whispered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they talking about?&rdquo; whispered
Andy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everything in general. They are certainly
crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to let Mr. Strong know of this,&rdquo;
said Pepper.</p>
<p>The boys watched the two men for some time
and saw that it was probable they would remain
in the camp that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;Andy can
ride to the school and tell Mr. Strong, while Jack
and I watch the men. If they go away we can
follow and see where they go to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was arranged, and a little later Andy rode
off on Jack&rsquo;s wheel. Jack and Pepper kept well
out of sight, but made certain that Shaff and Callax
should not slip them in the darkness which
was now settling down upon all sides.</p>
<p>Andy took care that he should have no more
accidents, and as a consequence it took him quite
a while to reach Putnam Hall. Once there he
asked at once for George Strong. The assistant
teacher was in the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to see you in private, Mr. Strong,&rdquo; said
the cadet, and having walked outside with the
instructor, the acrobatic youth told his tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is indeed news,&rdquo; said George Strong.
&ldquo;We must capture them by all means. It is
criminal to leave such dangerous characters at
large.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>Captain Putnam was informed of the affair,
and he told Peleg Snuggers and another man
around the place to go with George Strong and
Andy. The carryall was brought out, with a
pair of good horses, and away they started on a
good gait for the camp in the woods.</p>
<p>They had just reached the spot where the
bicycles had been left when they heard a blood-curdling
cry. Then came a shout in Jack&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been discovered!&rdquo; cried Andy, and
leaped from the carryall, followed by George
Strong and Peleg Snuggers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, or they may shoot you!&rdquo; said the
general-utility man, taking good care to keep well
to the rear.</p>
<p>Another shout, this time from Pepper, rang
out, and then those who had just come up saw
two men rush through the forest in the direction
of the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they go!&rdquo; cried George Strong.
&ldquo;Stop, Paul! Stop, Bart!&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us alone!&rdquo; said Callax. &ldquo;Let us alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want anything to do with you!&rdquo; put
in Shaff.</p>
<p>They made rapid progress through the forest
and soon George Strong lost track of them. But
then Jack sighted them again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There they go&mdash;straight for the lake!&rdquo;
shouted the young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see them,&rdquo; answered the teacher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are getting into a boat,&rdquo; said Pepper,
and he was right.</p>
<p>By the time the party gained the lake shore the
two crazy men were in a rowboat and pulling
rapidly across the lake. The others looked
around, but not another craft of any sort was in
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have lost them again!&rdquo; said George
Strong, with something like a groan. &ldquo;Too
bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they discover you?&rdquo; asked Andy,
after the darkness had hidden the fleeing men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the oddest kind of a way,&rdquo; explained Jack.
&ldquo;We were resting behind some bushes, when of a
sudden the man named Callax leaped up and began
to prance around the camp like a horse. He
came straight for us, and landed within a few
inches of my head. Then he let out a yell and
that brought Shaff, and off they went like a pair
of frightened rabbits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curious to know what sort of a camp the crazy
men had had, George Strong went back to the
spot and stirred up the campfire. He found there
a good supply of clothing and also many odds and
ends which made the boys smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they will come back,&rdquo; suggested
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will place a guard here,&rdquo; answered the
teacher. &ldquo;They may come back later. I doubt
if they do so right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but to return to Putnam
Hall. The bicycles were strapped on the
back of the carryall and all piled into the turnout.
The lantern had already been lit; and thus they
rode to the school, reaching the place a little after
midnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keeping early hours, I see,&rdquo; remarked Dale,
when Pepper came into the dormitory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you about it in the morning,&rdquo; answered
the Imp, and lost no time in getting to bed and to
sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those fellows will be the terror of this
neighborhood if they keep on,&rdquo; said Dale, when
he heard of what had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Strong is going to set a sharper watch
than ever,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;Those men will be
caught sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of the cadets had heard of the soldiers&rsquo;
reunion at Datport, on the following Saturday,
and also of the proposed balloon ascension, and
they begged Captain Putnam for permission to
visit the town and see what was going on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said the master of
the school at last. &ldquo;Every student who gets an
average of eighty per cent. this week can go, if
he wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This put the students on their mettle, and never
did cadets study harder than during that week.
As a consequence about forty passed, and it was
decided that they should visit Datport in the
Hall carryall and the two Cedarville stages.
The start was to be made at half-past six in the
morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah, we are to go!&rdquo; shouted Andy.
&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you glad, Pep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Reff Ritter an&rsquo; Coulter who are mad, so
they are,&rdquo; came from Emerald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they pass?&rdquo; asked Stuffer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a tight squeeze, with old Crabtree,&rdquo;
came from Bart Conners. &ldquo;He came close to
cutting me out of the fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same here,&rdquo; said Henry Lee. &ldquo;Oh, but
I do wish we could get rid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wish is to be gratified&mdash;at least for
awhile,&rdquo; said Joe Nelson. &ldquo;I just got the news.
Mr. Crabtree is going to Boston on business and
may not come back for the balance of this term.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted several students in unison.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you would like to get up a petition,
asking him to remain,&rdquo; went on Joe, with a
wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great hambones!&rdquo; gasped Pepper. &ldquo;Remain?
Not for a thousand plates of ice cream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can stay away and he never will be
missed,&rdquo; added Andy.</p>
<p>The boys were on hand promptly on Saturday
morning, and after an early breakfast they piled
into the carryall and the stages, and with shouts
and cheers set off for Datport. Not one of them
dreamed of the strange adventures and odd discovery
ahead of them.</p>
<p>The way to Datport was level for the most part
and the three turnouts made good time, the boys
singing and cheering as they passed through villages
and by prosperous farms. Many cheered
and waved their hands in return. They were
beginning to be known far and wide as &ldquo;those
Putnam Hall soldier boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see some of the old soldiers now!&rdquo; cried
Jack, as the turnouts approached the town where
the reunion was to occur. And soon they
reached a green where many old veterans were
assembled. The cadets, in their neat uniforms,
were given a warm welcome and soon made
themselves at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all right,&rdquo; said Pepper, as a fine band
struck up a patriotic air. &ldquo;I am glad I came.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I want to see that balloon ascension,&rdquo; returned
Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to go up, Andy?&rdquo; asked
Jack, by way of a joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I would,&rdquo; was the quick answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really mean it, Andy?&rdquo; asked Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do&mdash;I shouldn&rsquo;t like anything
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be afraid to go up,&rdquo; said Hogan. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
take my balloon trips on the ground, so I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The balloon ascension was advertised for two
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and after listening to an
address by an old army general, and getting some
lunch, the cadets walked to the field where the
balloon was located.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo! How are you?&rdquo; said a man to Jack,
and the young major recognized him as one of
the pair who had come out in the farm-wagon
after the balloon when the battalion had been on
the march.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First-rate,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;Found your
balloon, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, and all right, too. Much obliged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, doesn&rsquo;t the professor want somebody to
go up with him?&rdquo; asked Andy, brushing forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not!&rdquo; said another man, standing by.
&ldquo;Not a greenhorn, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the professor?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In his tent yonder, getting ready for the exhibition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The balloon was in a small roped-off enclosure
and some men were at work filling it with hot air.
Beside the balloon rested a big basket. It had
been advertised that the professor would take
somebody up with him provided that person
would remain in the balloon after the a&euml;ronaut
cut loose with his parachute, but so far nobody
had come forward to take up the offer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<h2 id="c27">CHAPTER XXVII
<br /><span class="small">UP IN A BALLOON</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;This would just suit me to death,&rdquo; said
Andy, as he gazed with longing eyes at the
balloon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in the basket and see how it feels,&rdquo; suggested
Jack.</p>
<p>The acrobatic youth was quick to comply. The
men working around were good-natured and did
not interfere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in here with me,&rdquo; said Andy, and
Pepper and Jack did as requested. Then Andy
began to examine the ropes which held the basket
to the balloon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The balloon is filling,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, what are you fellows doing in that balloon?&rdquo;
came from Nick Paxton, as he strode up.
He was the only one of the Baxter crowd that
had come to the celebration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is none of your business,&rdquo; answered
Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>At that moment came a shout from another
part of the grounds. Then followed a big explosion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cannon has burst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody must be killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The excitement was intense and for the moment
the balloon was forgotten. Hundreds
rushed over to where some gunners had been
discharging the old town cannon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son was helpin&rsquo; to fire that!&rdquo; said a man
who was working on the balloon ropes. &ldquo;I must
see if he was hurt!&rdquo; And off he ran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother was helping to load the cannon,&rdquo;
said another, and off he went likewise.</p>
<p>They had scarcely left when a sudden gust of
wind made the big balloon give a tug at the
ropes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we&rsquo;ll have to get out of this basket,&rdquo;
ejaculated Jack. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I was thinking,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; came from Andy.
&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;&mdash; Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The acrobatic youth&rsquo;s remark came to a sudden
stop, for just then the balloon gave another tug.
Crack! snap! went some ropes, and in a twinkling
up went the basket, carrying the three cadets with
it.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">
<img src="images/pic4.jpg" alt="UP WENT THE BASKET CARRYING THE THREE CADETS WITH IT" width="500" height="771" />
<p class="center small">UP WENT THE BASKET CARRYING THE THREE CADETS WITH IT</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hold fast!&rdquo; gasped Jack. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t,
you&rsquo;ll be killed!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>He clutched at the rim of the basket and so did
the others. Almost before they knew it they
were a hundred feet above the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The balloon has gone up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three of those cadets are in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy, Jack, and Pepper!&rdquo; came from Stuffer.
&ldquo;Hi! come back you!&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could,&rdquo; murmured Pepper.</p>
<p>The balloon attendants were clutching at a
rope that was trailing along the ground. Dale
and Stuffer leaped forward to aid them, and all
were quickly raised from their feet. Seeing
they could not stop the balloon, they dropped to
the ground, Dale landing on Paxton&rsquo;s shoulders
and sending him to the grass with a thud.</p>
<p>The excitement on the exhibition grounds was
intense, one half of the folks gathering around
the exploded cannon and the other half watching
the sailing balloon. Fortunately it was found
that nobody had been seriously hurt by the wrecking
of the field-piece, for which everybody was
thankful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who let that balloon go?&rdquo; stormed Professor
Aireo, as he came rushing from his tent. &ldquo;Who
did it?&rdquo; And he stormed around wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She got away, Bill, that&rsquo;s all I can tell,&rdquo; said
one of the attendants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make somebody pay damages,&rdquo; stormed
the professor, who in private life was plain Bill
Jones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get the balloon back first,&rdquo; put in a
man standing near.</p>
<p>In the meantime the balloon went up higher
and higher, until it was a good six hundred feet
in the air. Then the wind caught it and sent it
whirling over the town and some green fields beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wh&mdash;where are we going to?&rdquo; asked Pepper,
still clutching the basket with a deathlike grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
thankful if we are not upset and cast out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t be upset, so long as we remain in
the air,&rdquo; answered Andy, who, now that the first
excitement was over, was quite cool. &ldquo;I must
say I rather enjoy this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go ahead and enjoy it,&rdquo; grumbled
Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel dizzy?&rdquo; asked the acrobatic
youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little. The sudden rush upward made
me light-headed. But it is going away now,&rdquo;
answered the Imp.</p>
<p>On and on sailed the balloon. For the time
being Andy was the only one of the three who
dared to look downward, and he announced that
the town had been left far behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are sailing over a patch of woods,&rdquo; he
announced. &ldquo;Beyond is a hill of rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope we don&rsquo;t tumble on the rocks,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not going to tumble, I tell you, Jack.
This balloon will sail for miles before it begins
to settle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little while later Jack and Pepper ventured
to take a peep at what was below. They could
see the farms, with the houses and barns looking
like toy buildings. Here and there was a silver
thread, where some brook ran into the lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we are moving towards the lake,&rdquo; announced
Andy, some time later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we go down in the lake we&rsquo;ll be drowned,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to swim for it,&rdquo; answered Andy,
cheerfully. &ldquo;If we get too close to the water we
can take off our coats and kick off our shoes.
We ought all to be able to swim to shore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In five minutes more they crossed another
patch of woods and came out over the lake. Far
below them was a sailboat, and the occupants
looked up at the balloon in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are surely going down!&rdquo; cried Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>The balloon made a big dip, coming to within
two hundred feet of the lake surface. They were
preparing to shed their coats and shoes when a
gust took them upward once more and back to
the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not going down just yet,&rdquo; said Andy.
&ldquo;But I think the balloon will settle before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; asked Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the air,&rdquo; said Pepper, who could not resist
the temptation to joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where we are,&rdquo; answered Andy.
&ldquo;But there is a wild lot of timber and rocks below
us,&rdquo; he added, after a searching look downward.</p>
<p>The balloon continued to move onward, but
kept lowering constantly. Then came a sudden
jolt to the basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hit a tree-top,&rdquo; announced Andy.
&ldquo;We must be on our guard now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But once more the balloon took an upward
turn, and the forest remained a good hundred
feet below them. Then the wind appeared to
die out utterly and the balloon ceased to move
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all right,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;Now, fellows,
prepare to catch hold of a limb or something,
when we go down.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>All were on the alert and watched the gradual
settling of the big balloon with interest. The hot
air had become cooled, and in a few seconds the
basket struck the top of a tree and went over.
The three cadets were spilled out in a most undignified
fashion. They caught hold of the limbs
as best they could and swung themselves towards
the tree trunk. Then the balloon settled down
over the top of the tree, forming a regular tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<h2 id="c28">CHAPTER XXVIII
<br /><span class="small">THREE BOYS AND THREE DOGS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Are you all right, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about you, Pep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As right as a button. Say, that was a ride
worth talking about, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it was,&rdquo; said the young major.
&ldquo;I must say, though, I shouldn&rsquo;t care for another
like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It suits me to a T!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know but what I&rsquo;d like to be a balloon acrobat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The weight of the big balloon made the upper
branches of the tree bend far down, while a few
of them were broken. Fearing the whole top of
the tree might snap off, the three cadets climbed
down with caution until they reached the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are, safe and sound!&rdquo; cried Andy,
doing a handspring, just to work off his high
spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t crow, Andy; we are not yet out of the
woods,&rdquo; returned Jack, with a faint smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me we are much in the woods,&rdquo;
came from Pepper, as he gazed around. &ldquo;I
must confess I haven&rsquo;t the least idea where we
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Jack, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the ground. There, that pays you back
for telling me we were in the air awhile ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have sailed seven or eight miles at
least,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;Remember, the breeze was
a pretty fair one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we came about fifty miles,&rdquo; answered
Pepper. &ldquo;And we seemed to be about
five miles high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t live at five miles, you know
that,&rdquo; answered Jack, quickly. &ldquo;Science teaches
that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother science, unless it can connect us
with a refreshment stand,&rdquo; interrupted Pepper.
&ldquo;I am awfully dry, and hungry too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They gazed around them. On all sides was
the tall timber. The ground was very uneven
and rocky in spots. Some of the rocks were
damp, but they could not locate any spring or
brook.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing to do is to get out of this
woods,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Then perhaps we can strike
a farmhouse and get some refreshments. I am
not hungry, but I&rsquo;d like to have a drink of cold
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d refuse a nice piece of pie?&rdquo; said
Pepper, sarcastically. &ldquo;Or some fresh doughnuts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Pep!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;I am getting hungry
now. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was the question, and the three cadets
stared around them helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the sun the lake must be in that direction,&rdquo;
said Jack. &ldquo;Let us try to reach the water. Perhaps
we can hail some passing boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others agreed, and leaving the balloon
where it was, they made their way among the tall
trees for a distance of several rods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo! here&rsquo;s a road!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;This
must lead to somewhere. We are in luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t lead down to the lake,&rdquo; said
Jack.</p>
<p>However, it was decided to follow the road for
awhile, which seemed to pass from the woods
quarter of a mile further on. Then they came
to an apple orchard, but, of course, none of the
apples were ripe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hark! I hear some dogs approaching!&rdquo;
ejaculated Jack, a few minutes later. &ldquo;I hope
they are not unfriendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are bulldogs!&rdquo; came from Pepper.
&ldquo;Say, I don&rsquo;t like this at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; added Andy, as the dogs came closer.
There were three bulldogs, all of large size, and
each looked particularly savage.</p>
<p>The three boys did not know what to do, but as
the bulldogs came closer, Andy ran for a nearby
tree. The others followed, and all got up into
the tree just as the animals reached the vicinity.</p>
<p>The dogs were baying loudly, and as they
gathered under the tree, they snapped and snarled
in anything but a pleasant fashion. They had
evidently run quite a distance, for they looked
hot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a pretty kettle of fish,&rdquo; remarked Jack.
&ldquo;We got out of one difficulty only to tumble into
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I don&rsquo;t want to tumble just now,&rdquo;
answered Pepper, with a shake of his head. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think those brutes would like anything
better than to chew us up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if I can beat them off with a stick?&rdquo;
said Andy, beginning to cut off a tree-bough with
his pocketknife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, but you can try it,&rdquo; answered
the young major.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>The stick was cut and Andy let himself down
to a lower limb. He hit one of the dogs just
once. Then the animal made a leap, caught hold
of the stick, and had not Andy let go he would
have been jerked to the ground. As it was he
swung clear around the limb and only his acrobatic
skill saved him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you try that again,&rdquo; warned Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I will. Gosh! he almost had me;
didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dogs made themselves at home under the
tree, lying down, but keeping their eyes fixed on
the prisoners. The moment one of the lads
moved there would be a growl from below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d make good camp guards, if they were
trained,&rdquo; said Pepper, with a sorry kind of a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no laughing matter,&rdquo; expostulated
Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m laughing. I&rsquo;d give a
week&rsquo;s spending money to be out of this right
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ditto here,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>A half-hour went by and still the dogs remained
at the foot of the tree. Occasionally one
would walk around a bit and growl, but that was
all. The boys tried everything they could
think of to chase the brutes away, but without
avail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I see somebody coming!&rdquo; said Andy,
later on. He had climbed to the top of the tree
to make observations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us yell for help,&rdquo; suggested Pepper, and
all three immediately set up as loud a shout as
their lungs would permit. At first there was no
reply, but then a faint hello came back, and Andy
saw the man running towards them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he owns the dogs he&rsquo;ll aid us,&rdquo; said the acrobatic
youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but if he doesn&rsquo;t what is he to do?&rdquo; asked
Jack, quickly. &ldquo;We ought to warn him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again they set up a shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out for the dogs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked the man, coming to a
halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out for the dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three bulldogs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right&mdash;the dogs are mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough,&rdquo; murmured Jack. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll
get some help, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man came nearer. He was dressed in a
riding-suit and carried a short whip in one hand.
As he came closer the bulldogs ran towards him
in a friendly way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, do you know who he is?&rdquo; asked Jack,
suddenly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haverick, the horse-dealer&mdash;the man who
owned the dog I shot while we were at target
practice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<h2 id="c29">CHAPTER XXIX
<br /><span class="small">THE OLD WELL</span></h2>
<p>The announcement the young major made was
true&mdash;the man who had come up was really Sam
Haverick, the horse-dealer, a fellow known far
and wide around the lake for his sharp deals in
horseflesh.</p>
<p>As soon as he caught sight of the cadets&rsquo; uniforms
his face took on a sour look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you youngsters from Putnam Hall?&rdquo; he
asked, as he came to a halt under the tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; answered Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many of you up there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! What are you doing there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dogs drove us up here,&rdquo; said Andy. Jack
was purposely keeping in the background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As they are your dogs we would like you to
call them off,&rdquo; continued Pepper. &ldquo;They have
kept us treed about long enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they know you,&rdquo; said the horse-dealer,
with a scowl. &ldquo;One of you cadets killed one of
their mates.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The mad dog,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t mad! He only wanted to have
some fun. Say, why don&rsquo;t you show yourself?&rdquo;
shouted the man, to Jack.</p>
<p>As there was no help for it, the young major
stepped out on a tree-limb in full view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see now. You are Jack Ruddy, the lad
who shot my dog. Ain&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did shoot the dog,&rdquo; answered Jack, boldly.
&ldquo;But I only did it because he was mad and because
he wanted to bite Mrs. Bennington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense! You shot the dog because
you thought it was smart!&rdquo; growled the
horse-dealer. &ldquo;I ought to have had you locked
up for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an awkward pause. The boys felt
that they could expect anything but kind treatment
from Sam Haverick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to call off the dogs?&rdquo; asked
Pepper, at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will&mdash;on one condition,&rdquo; answered the man,
and there was a shrewd look in his face as he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Jack, although he knew
about what was coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you pay for the dog you shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we have fifty dollars with us?&rdquo;
cried Andy. &ldquo;Why, I haven&rsquo;t but eighty cents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have sixty-five cents,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got two dollars and a quarter,&rdquo; put in
Jack. &ldquo;But I am not going to give it to you,&rdquo; he
added, with spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Then you can stay in the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t do that either,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;Call off those dogs and be quick about it. I
am coming down, and if your dogs attack me,
you&rsquo;ll go to prison for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Call off the
dogs, quick! Here I come!&rdquo; And he started to
drop down.</p>
<p>The horse-dealer was a good deal of a brute,
but he was likewise a coward, and he did not dare
to allow his dogs to attack the boys. As they
came down out of the tree, he whistled to the bulldogs
and they crouched behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you think you&rsquo;re smart,&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are standing up for our rights, that is
all,&rdquo; answered Jack. &ldquo;Now we are going on our
way. If those dogs come after us again, I&rsquo;ll get
Captain Putnam to have you locked up for allowing
such brutes at liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go to grass!&rdquo; grumbled Sam Haverick,
and strode off, with his dogs following him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>As he went in one direction, the boys thought it
wise to take the other. They continued on the
road, and quarter of an hour later came in sight
of a small farmhouse, perched on a hillside and
surrounded with fields of grain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you were really in that balloon!&rdquo; said the
farmer after he had heard their story. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t it
beat all now! I wouldn&rsquo;t go up in one of them
pesky things not fer a million dollars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I wouldn&rsquo;t go fer three million,&rdquo; said his
wife, who was in the kitchen baking.</p>
<p>The boys asked if they could purchase some
lunch and were given some sandwiches, fresh
cake, and all the milk they could drink. The
farmer wanted no pay, but each cadet insisted
upon giving his wife a quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This road will take you to Cedarville,&rdquo; said
the farmer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long way around though.
A short way is by the trail over yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the trail a good one?&rdquo; asked Pepper,
cautiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, we don&rsquo;t want to lose our way
again,&rdquo; explained Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you can lose your way,&rdquo; answered
the farmer. &ldquo;Keep to the trail until you
come to some tall rocks. Then turn to your left,
go around the rocks, and you&rsquo;ll come out on the
old Borden Road, which runs straight down to
Cedarville.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That looks easy enough,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>The three cadets soon set off, and in a few
minutes the farmhouse was out of sight. They
passed through a patch of woods, then across a
meadow, and then followed the trail beside a tiny
brook, which seemed alive with trout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the spot for fishing,&rdquo; exclaimed Pepper.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I wish I had a line!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stop to fish now,&rdquo; answered Jack.
&ldquo;Remember, the folks will be worried about us
until we report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true. But we can come here some
other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trail left the brook a little further on, and
then they came to a point where the way was uncertain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go slow now,&rdquo; cautioned the young major.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to become tangled up if we can
possibly avoid it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here seems to be a cleared spot,&rdquo; said Pepper,
gazing around. &ldquo;I wonder if there was once
a farm here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there was it must have been abandoned
years ago,&rdquo; answered Andy. &ldquo;To me it&rsquo;s a perfect
wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started to go on, when suddenly Andy
sank down in the soil a distance of about two
feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; he yelled, and scrambled out of the
hole as quickly as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I wonder if that is another cave?&rdquo;
muttered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t seem to touch bottom,&rdquo; answered the
acrobatic youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us examine it, just for fun,&rdquo; said Pepper,
and walked back before the others could stop him.
He picked up a dead tree-branch and poked it into
the hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t touch bottom,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better come away before you fall in,&rdquo;
said Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I think?&rdquo; went on the
Imp. &ldquo;I think it is an old well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A well? out here?&rdquo; came from Andy, with a
skeptical look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both of the others were now interested, and
made an examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is a well, and the top had been
choked up most likely for years,&rdquo; declared the
young major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick a tree-limb in the hole,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;That will prevent somebody else from going
down into it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>This was done, and they started to go ahead
once more. They had covered only fifty feet
when Jack suddenly came to a halt as if electrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never!&rdquo; he gasped, after a look ahead
and then a look behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo; asked Andy and Pepper, in
a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember Mr. Strong&rsquo;s story about
that hidden pot of gold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember that his great-grandfather
left a letter, stating the pot of gold was
hidden under the tree that had the stone in its
roots,&mdash;the tree that stood twenty paces north cf
the old well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yonder is the old well, and here is the
stone, about twenty paces north of it. The tree
blew down years ago, but here is a part of the
stump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think the pot of gold is there?&rdquo;
almost shouted Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be found out,&rdquo; answered
Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<h2 id="c30">CHAPTER XXX
<br /><span class="small">SOMETHING OF A FIND&mdash;CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p>The discovery which Jack had made filled all
three of the cadets with excitement, and they
gazed at the rock and tree-root in wonder and
expectation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope the pot of gold is really there!&rdquo;
cried Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to dig for it,&rdquo; returned Pepper.
&ldquo;Come on! I wish I had a spade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to use our knives and some sticks,&rdquo;
put in the young major. &ldquo;And our hands too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were soon digging away at the foot of
the rock. Then they pulled away some of the
rotten tree-roots that were near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, there is a snake!&rdquo; ejaculated Andy,
a moment later. But the reptile was small and
harmless, and quickly got out of sight in the
bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if there are any more around,&rdquo; ventured
Jack. He did not like snakes in the least.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to keep our eyes open,&rdquo; answered
Pepper.</p>
<p>Once more they made the dirt fly, loosening it
with their knives and some sharp-pointed sticks,
and scooping it away with their hands. They
did not mind getting dirty&mdash;all their thoughts
were on uncovering the pot of gold, if it was
really there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t look like anything,&rdquo; grumbled
Andy, after they had been digging the best part
of half an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to give up?&rdquo; questioned Jack,
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a flat stone,&rdquo; said Pepper. &ldquo;It is
quite large, too. We will have some trouble getting
it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is placed directly over the pot of
gold,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>They worked all around the flat stone and then
pried up one end with a heavy stick. Pepper
placed his hand beneath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is something under it,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;Feels like an iron pot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us get that stone up!&rdquo; cried Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>They tugged and strained with might and
main, and at last the flat rock came up out of the
hole. Beneath was the cover to an old rusty
pot and beneath this the pot itself, resting in a bed
of dirt and small stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! here it is!&rdquo; cried Andy. &ldquo;Bring it
up, Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no easy matter to bring up the iron pot,
which was heavy, but at last they had it out on
the grass. The lid was rusted fast, but they
speedily pried it off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Empty!&rdquo; ejaculated Pepper, looking into the
receptacle, and his face fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All our work for nothing,&rdquo; murmured Andy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is not empty,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;That is an
iron plate resting near the bottom. Wait till I
pry it up with my knife blade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He set to work, and soon the iron plate came
up. Beneath lay some dull yellow round pieces
of metal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gold!&rdquo; shouted the young major. &ldquo;Old
English and Spanish gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure it is gold?&rdquo; queried Pepper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Look for yourself,&rdquo; and Jack brushed
off one of the pieces on his coat-sleeve. &ldquo;Boys,
we&rsquo;re in luck! We have certainly found the pot
with gold in it that Mr. Strong has been looking
for so long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much gold,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;I thought
there would be a pot full.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t take much gold to make quite a
sum, Andy. You know a ten-dollar gold piece
isn&rsquo;t very large.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys inspected the pieces with interest and
counted them up. All told there were four hundred
and twenty-three pieces, some large and
some small, English, French, and Spanish gold,
as they made out by some of the tarnished markings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us take the pot and all along,&rdquo; said Pepper.
&ldquo;Mr. Strong will wish to see the whole
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let us mark this place, so we can find it
again,&rdquo; added Andy.</p>
<p>They hung the pot with its contents on a stout
stick, and two carried it at a time. Having
marked the neighborhood, they set off along the
trail, and after a rather tedious walk reached the
highway running into Cedarville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where we are now,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;We
needn&rsquo;t go all the way to Cedarville. We can
branch off a little way below here and go directly
to Putnam Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed his advice, and half an hour
later, just as the sun was setting, came in sight of
the school. They were soon seen, and a shout
went up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are Jack, Andy, and Pepper now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get hurt on your balloon trip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you leave the balloon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were afraid you were all killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were some of the remarks and questions
uttered by those who had returned to the Hall
after the departure of the balloon with the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are safe and sound,&rdquo; said Jack, speaking
for himself and his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got there?&rdquo; asked Dale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something for Mr. Strong,&rdquo; whispered Pepper.
&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Hall. Captain Putnam is out hunting
for you. He said if you were found, to fire
the cannon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, then fire it,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
<p>The three boys marched into the Hall with
their precious burden. They were told that Mr.
Strong had gone to his room, and so followed up
the stairs and knocked on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! back, safe and sound!&rdquo; cried the
teacher. &ldquo;I am more than glad to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are glad to be back,&rdquo; answered Jack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what made you run off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t run off. We were carried off
against our will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! well! I suppose&mdash;&mdash; What is that
thing?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This, Mr. Strong, is something we suspect belongs
to you,&rdquo; said Jack, proudly. &ldquo;It is the
missing pot of gold&mdash;only it isn&rsquo;t full by any
means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pot of gold? Surely I must be dreaming!&rdquo;
gasped the teacher. &ldquo;Where did you get
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their tale was speedily told in detail, and the
gold was examined with much interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be true,&rdquo; said George Strong. &ldquo;What
an extraordinary ending to an extraordinary adventure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the cannon on the campus boomed
out&mdash;the signal that the boys had returned to
Putnam Hall.</p>
<p>The shot soon brought Captain Putnam back
to the school, and he listened to the cadets&rsquo; story
with as close attention as had George Strong.
He had already heard from Dale, Stuffer, Hogan,
and Joe Nelson how the balloon had started
away, and so could not blame the boys very
much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was imprudent for you to get into the
basket,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But as nobody was hurt, we
will let it pass. But the balloonist wants his balloon
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can have it, and welcome,&rdquo; said Jack.
&ldquo;After this I&rsquo;ll do my ballooning on the ground!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ditto here,&rdquo; said Pepper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I rather enjoyed it,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d go
again&mdash;if I got the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while you are a pupil under my care,&rdquo;
said Captain Putnam, decidedly.</p>
<p>On the following day the balloon was located
by those who owned it and brought over to
Cedarville, and on Monday the professor gave an
exhibition to which Captain Putnam and his
pupils contributed liberally. This satisfied Professor
Aireo and he departed for parts unknown,
and that ended the matter.</p>
<p>As soon as possible George Strong found out
the value of the coins the iron pot had contained,
and had the boys take him to the spot where the
treasure had been located.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gold is worth exactly six thousand and
two hundred dollars,&rdquo; said the teacher. &ldquo;I shall
divide it up with my relatives. The question is,
What part of the sum do you think you ought to
have for finding it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave that to you?&rdquo; said Andy, who was
not overly rich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would a hundred dollars each suit you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suits me,&rdquo; said the acrobatic youth, and
Jack and Pepper said they were also satisfied.
Later on each got the amount mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you located those crazy men yet?&rdquo;
asked Jack.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In a way, yes. They took a boat to Ithaca,
and then a train for the north. Perhaps they
have left the neighborhood for good.&rdquo; But in
this statement George Strong was mistaken, as
later events proved.</p>
<p>The balloon adventure made Andy, Jack, and
Pepper the heroes of the Hall for the time being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never have another adventure as thrilling
as that,&rdquo; said Pepper, but he was mistaken;
they did have an adventure equally thrilling, and
what it was I shall relate in another volume of
this series, to be called &ldquo;The Putnam Hall Champions;
or, Bound to Win Out.&rdquo; In that volume
we shall meet all our friends once more, and likewise
some of their enemies, and learn the particulars
of a victory which led to a most unlooked-for
discovery.</p>
<p>Summer was now at hand, and one bright
Saturday the boys had a regular field-day, with a
big spread afterwards. Jack, Andy, Pepper, and
the others did very well, winning several prizes.
Harry Blossom made a neat speech, and then all
sat down to a meal which made Stuffer Singleton&rsquo;s
eyes fairly glisten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This day is the limit!&rdquo; cried Andy, while the
eating was going on. &ldquo;I was never so happy in
my life before.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any schoolboys could be happier
than we are,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;Especially with old
Crabtree gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop Crabtree,&rdquo; sang out Dale. &ldquo;He will
come back all too soon, don&rsquo;t fear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes Captain Putnam!&rdquo; announced
Pepper. &ldquo;Let us give him a cheer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All agreed, and the cheer went echoing across
the lake and the hills far and wide, and with that
cheer let us take our departure.</p>
